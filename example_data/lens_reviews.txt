This is a sweet little lens that really has no middle ground.  You either love it or hate it.  Most of the haters really either expect too much from this lens such as focusing in no light or on objects with no contrast and marginal light.  The other reason there are detractors come from focus issues. This seems to be a user problem in my opinion.  When you shoot at f 1.4, the area in focus can be pretty shallow.  An example is at f1.4 and at a distance of 5 feet, the areas in focus is just .45 feet.  If you have a DSLR with multiple focus points, you might find what you want in focus is not selected by the camera.  This gives the impression of a focus issue with the lens which it is not. If you move into close focusing such as 2 feet using f1.4, the focus area becomes less than ? of an inch.  Even the slightest movement by you or the subject can blow the focus.  Again, this is not a lens problem but a user issue. However, don't be discouraged by the above comments.  This lens has so many possibilities from creative images to group portraits to low light photography.  You just need to put in a little effort to learn the lens (and your DSLR).  Also remember that stopped down to f4 at 10' gives you 5.45 feet in focus. The 30mm lens also is about as close to a 50mm lens on a 35mm film SLR as there is.  A 50mm lens was considered the de facto standard for an SLR in the old days and many people never had anything else.  This is a very versatile lens. The lens itself has an excellent build quality and includes extras such as a lens hood and case.  It is sharp and offers great contrast and compares well against such a well regarded lens as the Canon 35mm f1.4L which is about 3 times the price. You will not be disappointed in this lens at all and I highly recommend it.  It is one of my favorite everyday lenses for my Canon 20D.  (My everyday kit includs the Canon 17-40mm f4L, 70-200mm f4L, and a Canon 580ex flash.)

I've had this lens for a couple of days and have shot in a variety of situations. The image is somewhat soft at f/1.4, but sharpens quickly as you stop it down -- f/1.8 looks much sharper and f/2 is excellent. From a purely practical standpoint, you can shoot in lower light w/o external lighting, and you can run higher shutter speeds in low light for better action-stopping when shooting people or animals. I was also amazed at the incredibly small depth of field I could attain -- for example, I was able to narrow the focus down to a single stem of a plant and have every other part of the plant far out of focus. Not something I've been able to do with my Canon 17-85mm and 10-22mm zooms. It's a heavy lens but it balances well on a 20D. Autofocus seems nearly as fast as with my Canon lenses. My one complaint is that the focusing mechanism (in auto or manual) isn't as smooth or quiet as with my Canons -- it sounds a bit rough in auto, and makes a slight "barking seal" sound as you go from close to distant focus manually. Nice of Sigma to include the lens hood and case, instead of charging exhorbitant amounts for the hood as Canon does. Overall, this is a very useful addition to my zooms, and it will definitely allow me to get usable natural-light photos in situations where I couldn't before.

This is one of the most controversial lenses ever, it seems. why all the fuss over this little guy? Simple, it cleverly exploits a hole in nikon's product lineup as a wide aperture (f/1.4) prime lens with HSM (hypersonic motor) at a price point just above nikon's older, slower 35/2 prime. Therefore nikon purists hate it with a passion, while 3rd party aficionados tend to have a more open mind. First off, if you're looking for something razor sharp at f/1.4 try zeiss or get over it. it's no fillet chef wide open, but that's not the point. the point is that you CAN use it at 1.4, which means it can shoot in light a 2.8 would be challenged by. also you can stop it down a few  clicks and still be at 2.8, or shoot at f/2 or 2.2 and not be completely wide open. Second, while i'm sure there are sample variations out there, don't be put off by doomsayers on internet forums. opinions of actual users are one thing, but i dont know how people who have never used the lens can qualify it whatsoever. (but if you do order this lens, make sure its from a vendor with a good return policy. check for front focus issues when you get it; if you have a problem, sigma will recalibrate the lens. saves them money in the QC department, but at least they have good customer service.) for the record, i own three sigma lenses, all EX series, all bought online, and they all worked perfectly fine from day one. There are two categories of folks who will be looking at this lens: d40/d40x/d60 users and everybody else. for a d40/60 kinda person who wants to take no-flash, low light pics, there are no other options in this focal length and aperture class with an internal motor. period. you'd have to go to the micro-nikkor 60mm or 105VR to get an AF-S prime. sigma is coming out with a 50/1.4 HSM, but the 30's "normal" perspective is better suited for DX camera sensors with their 1.5 crop. nikon d80/200/300/700 owners can use any of nikon's (or sigma's) primes with full AF capability. unless you absolutely need f/1.4, the nikon 35/2 is cheaper and probably sharper. it doesn't have an internal motor, though, so for low-light action shots, the sigma is better suited for that application. but if you just need something inobtrusive for street shooting, candids, or a lower-profile lens, and arent worried about max aperture or AF speed, go for the 35/2. okay, how about some pros and cons: Pros: --not a small lens but lightweight. --low profile and normal perspective perfect for street/doc and candids. -- 1.4 maximum aperture makes this perfect for extreme low-light shooting. -- shallow dof at wide apertures results in creamy bokeh (out of focus elements) --HSM ensures fast AF; will work on D-series cameras without internal motors. -- takes 67mm filters. --sharp in the center at all apertures. --contrasty IQ --using fixed focal length lens forces you to focus on composition. -- EX build is better than sigma's bottom-barrel lenses, plus EX lenses have add'l 3-year warranty. --makes a good low-light solution for folks with slow variable-aperture kit lenses (i.e., 18-55, 18-70, 18-135, 18-200) Cons: --1.4 aperture gives extremely narrow depth of field. this makes this lens extremely tricky when shooting wide open, as shallow depth of field can be mistaken for focus issues. -- focal range is not as versatile as a zoom -- how much are you really gonna shoot at 1.4? --IQ not as impressive as cheaper nikkor 50/1.8 --soft corners at almost all apertures (this matters less than you might think in low-light situations) --some known QC issues (which may be somewhat exaggerated) --more expensive than nikon 50/1.8, 50/1.4, and 35/2 primes. overall: recommended for d40/d60 users, low-light/available-light fanatics, street/doc shooters, people who will stay with DX for a while. not recommended for nikon nazis, or folks who may eventually migrate to FX. in practical use, this lens is probably more essential on an entry-level or mid level DSLR than a d300, d700, or D3. those cameras' improved high ISO performance means you can often stop down a 2.8 lens to f/4 in low light, lessening the need for a 1.4 aperture. on a d/40/50/60/80/200, however, you can keep the noise down in low light situations by shooting at wide apertures and not going above ISO 800. also, this is a DC lens, meaning that it is designed for DX sensors. FX-curious folks should probably get the nikkor 35/2 instead. while the 30/1.4 lens sees a lot of low-light use, its normal perspective and wide max aperture make it versatile in many conditions.  i've stopped it down to f/8-f/11 and found it takes good landscape shots too. you never know when you might run into a situation where 1.4 is needed. it's a good one to have in the bag, just in case.

I did a lot of research prior to buying this lens.  Many people reported significant front focusing issues with their copies.  Some responded that the front focusing issues were operator error.  So I decided to take a chance. After conducting numerous focusing tests on charts, my copy also has significant front focusing issues at all apertures.  In real world use, the focus issues became apparent quickly.  So I decided to contact Sigma. Sigma stated that the focusing problem is not with their lenses, but rather with my Nikon D80 and other Nikon cameras.  I informed them that my D80 focuses properly with 3 different Nikkor lenses, but they still denied there could be a problem.  After inspecting the sample, they also were UNABLE TO FIX any problem (probably because they wouldn't acknowledge a problem existed, even with the test charts showing front focus). Anyone who dismisses the front focusing issues as operator error ignores the fact that people who buy speciality lenses, such as the Sigma 30mm, generally are experienced photographers.  Additionally, the same high number of front focus issues aren't experienced with other similar lenses, such as the Nikon 28 f/1.4.  It seems like poor quality control to me. YOU RUN THE RISK OF BUYING A LENS THAT IS USEFUL ONLY FOR MANUAL FOCUS IF YOU BUY THIS LENS, AND WHERE YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO HAVE IT REPAIRED VIA WARRANTY. However, the lens is built from quality materials.  Using manual focus, photos are sharp, although I am noticing some softness as you move from the center of the frame.  Assuming the auto focus issues could be resolved through adjustment, it would have been lot of lens for $369. A 5 star lens is a lens that is tack-sharp straight from the factory, with a functional design that has no significant problems and rivals the best Nikon lenses made.  If the focus issues could be corrected, this is a 3 star lens.  It works.  It's sharp enough.  It's pretty good.  I think we as consumers are so hungry for quality in this focal length that we over-rate lenses when something - anything - is available.  But let's be honest.  If a quality alternative existed that didn't have these focus issues, we'd probably buy the alternative.

After researching the various offerings from Nikon and others, I purchased this lens to serve as a Portrait and general-purpose low-light lens.  The published reviews have been very positive, which ultimately made my purchasing decision easier.  [For those interested, I am utilizing this lens with Nikon's D2X top-of-the-line digital SLR.] First off, bear in mind that this lens is intended to be a 50mm-equivalent, and is designed exclusively for Nikon DX digital SLRs.  (All Nikon digital SLRs have a 1.5x "lens factor," due to the fact that the sensor is smaller than 35mm film.)  Sigma states the following in the product specifications, but let me repeat it here: it is NOT designed for full-frame (e.g. 35mm) use! In terms of comparable offerings from Nikon, they are: Nikon 28mm f/2.8D AF, Nikon 35mm f/2D AF, Nikon 50mm f/1.4D AF and 50mm f/1.8D AF.  The two latter lenses are not really in the same category, as they are 75mm-equivalent on Nikon digital SLRs.  The two former lenses are close in terms of focal length, so they are reasonable alternatives. There are several key differences between Sigma's 30mm lens and Nikon's aforementioned 28mm and 35mm lenses.  First up, Sigma's lens is equivalent to a Nikon "G-type" lens.  Specifically, this means that Sigma's lens does not have a dial to set the aperture; instead, the aperture is set on the camera body.  This is incredibly convenient, and allows one to quickly change the aperture while framing the picture in the viewfinder.  Nikon's 28mm and 35mm lenses, in contrast, are the older "D-type" lens.  Meaning, they both utilize an aperture dial. The other key difference between Sigma's lens and Nikon's 28mm and 35mm, is that Sigma's utilizes a "Hyper Sonic Motor" for autofocusing.  As a result, autofocus action is extremely fast and quiet.  Nikon's 28mm and 35mm do not utilize a comparable technology, and instead make do with an older -- and slower/louder -- mechanism. And finally, a word on optical quality.  Because Sigma's lens is so super-fast optics-wise (i.e., the fast f/1.4 maximum aperture), depth-of-field can be extremely shallow.  So shallow that, when taking a portrait at, say, 3 feet away, one can focus on the tip of the subject's nose -- with the rest of the subject's face slightly soft!  (One might want to generally focus on the subject's eyes, but that is neither here nor there.)  The point being, that when fully opened up at f/1.4 or f/1.7, it is easy to confuse the optical quality of the lens (which I have found to be outstanding!) with soft focus due to shallow depth-of-field.  [For any newbies: this is a "feature" of fast aperture optics.] Bottom line, the Sigma 30mm lens provides superb low-light performance (thanks to the fast f/1.4 maximum aperture), along with outstanding optical performance.  It is highly recommended for any Nikon digital SLR owner who is looking for a 50mm-equivalent portrait/general-purpose lens.  You will not be disappointed!

4 stars becaus of occasional misfocus (may be less than 1%) but 99% gave great results, sharp even at F1.4 wide open. I have taken many photos with this lens mosly at f1.4 and here are the photos taken recently (24 Sept 2005) in my website: [...] And some previous samples here: [...] I was hesitated between the Canon 35mm f2 but thought that f2 was not wide enough. I had the 50mm f1.8 MKII but the Sigma 30mm wins hands down!! In fact I sold my 50mm f1.8 for this reason and that 50mm was too long for indoors. You will not regret it!

The Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM stays on my D70 about 60%-70% of the time. Colors and contrast are excellent. It's a fantastic low light lens. I've also owned the Nikkor 35mm f/2D, but remember: you get something like *twice* the light from the Sigma @ f/1.4 than you do with the Nikkor @ f/2. While the Nikkor is an excellent lens in its own right, I've obtained low light sports shots with the Sigma that I'd never get with the Nikkor 35mm. Edge to edge sharpness is very good. For example, I have a picture taken at a temple where the primary subject is a young woman in a red dress covered in very small white flowers (the dress, not the woman). Even though she appears in the left third of the image, you can see every single flower on her dress. The flower detail makes the image. I also own the Nikkor 17-35mm f/2.8D and while it's an exceptional lens, I generally find myself going with the bigger aperture of the Sigma and simple "zooming" with my feet. I have not compared the Sigma to the Nikkor 28mm f/1.4, but for the price difference the Nikkor just doesn't tempt me. One and only reservation about this lens: sample variation, hence the 4/5 stars. I had to return the first one due to focusing problems. Nothing was sharp, ever, and no, it was not operator error. But I am 100% happy with the second copy. Just as long as you buy from Amazon (or anyone with a good return policy, really) you should be fine. I'm so happy with this lens that I will be open-minded about future Sigma lenses for my Nikons. That's saying something.

Wow.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  I'd had a couple of negative experiences with Sigma Lenses before.  Glad to say I was totally blown away by this lens.  It quickly has become of favorite.  Bright (expected at f/1.4) and FAST, FAST, FAST (a pleasant surprise).  I use this almost as much as my Zuiko 14-54 f/2.8-3.5. Suffice to say, I could not be more pleased.  Images are tack sharp.  Colors are true.  Effective focal length of 60mm is a super place for a prime lens to be. And given that this lens is on every vendor's backorder list from time to time, we can quickly see that it is fast becoming Sigma's 4/3rds superstar.  I love shooting with it and I suspect, so will you.

I purchased this lens for my Sony Alpha A700 camera. It's meant to be my all purpose lens. Here's some information about the lens that you may find helpful in deciding if you wish to purchase one: * The lens is made in Japan. Not Chinese junk. * The focal length of the lens is 30 mm which is equivalent to 45 mm on a full sized 36 x 24 frame (i.e. it's a "normal" lens - not wide or telephoto). * It's very well built. The focus ring turns smoothly. The fit and finish are superb. The lens has a nice looking matte black finish with a subtle gold ring trim. Very pretty. * The lens DOES NOT have a "focus clutch". This means that the focus ring rotates when the camera auto focuses. * The lens (when used with a Sony Alpha or Minolta camera) utilizes the CAMERA autofocus motor. The lens is NOT "HSM" (Hyper Sonic Motor) for _these_ cameras. * Focus is achieved by moving INTERNAL lens elements. The length of the lens does not change during focus. * The lens uses 62 millimeter filters (such as a glass or UV filter to protect the front element). * The lens has EIGHT iris leaves. This isn't "good" or "bad", it's just a fact. * The lens, optically, is scary razor sharp at F4.0 to F16 (the max). Below F4.0, the lens exhibits the very slightest softness, especially near the corners. The softness is VERY slight - hardly noticeable. * Wide open aperture is F1.4 - it's very bright and clear and takes amazing available light pictures. * I did not notice ANY chromatic aberration at any F stop. * The lens is "full of glass". The elements are huge and let in lots of light (F1.4). * The lens focuses from infinity down to about 15 inches. It's not a MACRO lens. * At wide apertures, the lens produces nice "bokeh" (the neat blur behind and in front of the main subject). Unlike Sony SAL series lenses, the Sigma 30mm has a polygonal iris rather than the "almost circular" iris of the Sony. This shows up as octagon shaped blurs on points of light which are behind or in front of the subject. This effect is really no problem, since people are used to seeing polygons in bokeh anyway. * The lens completely covers an APS-C sized digital imager with no vignetting. It's made specifically for 2/3 size digital cameras. It will NOT cover a full 35mm film sized frame (36 mm X 24 mm). * The lens comes with a nice "flower petal" style sunshade which can be snapped on or off as desired. * The lens comes with a nice, high quality padded zipper case to store the lens in if it's not on the camera. The case has a removable "mattress" in the bottom to allow storage of a different, longer lens if desired. The case has lots of potential uses. * The lens weighs a little bit less than one pound. It's just heavy enough to "feel good" but not so heavy as to make the camera unwieldy. The lens weight also perfectly balances the camera, which makes steady shooting even easier. * In normal light, the lens focuses quickly and accurately. In dim light, the lens sometimes seems to "lock onto" the wrong focus spot. Strangely, using the Sony A700 camera's "fast" focus mode seems to cure this problem. I had been using the "slow" setting with the impression that somehow it would make the focus "more accurate", but the Sigma lens seems to like the fast mode better. Strange. (NEW INFO): I recently had my Sony A700 camera in for repair to replace the CMOS image sensor. The repair center, among other things, recalibrated  the focus. After getting the camera back, I noticed that the focus "problem" (mentioned above) was gone. So, it was the camera, not the lens. Note that this lens is ALSO available for other camera brands such as Nikon, Canon, Pentax and Sigma. The lens comes with a NATIVE bayonet mount for each camera. It DOES NOT need or use a funky adapter. In summary, I've found this lens to be one heck of a good quality product and worth it's price. If you need a "normal" lens for your digital SLR, you won't be disappointed with the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC (*HSM) Lens. (*HSM on _some_ cameras, not all)

I was drawn to the Sigma after having used Nikon's competing 35mm f/1.8 lens and hearing many comments to the effect that, in addition to its greater speed, the Sigma offered better bokeh and significantly better build quality.  I also personally prefer the 30mm perspective for use as a "normal" lens on DX - so given the praise I'd seen for it, I bought a copy of the Sigma and have spent a fair amount of time using it, alongside the Nikkor, under a variety of shooting conditions. The advantages noted for the Sigma do exist, and they do work in its favor.  Nevertheless, I came away disappointed, and have gone back to using the Nikkor exclusively despite its minor drawbacks. There are two primary reasons for my dissatisfaction, which combined to lead to a single effect: unacceptable image quality at large apertures.  Let me first say that for my purposes, the only reason to use a fast prime lens is to use it at large apertures.  In circumstances where I don't need a large aperture, I will keep one of several excellent modern zoom lenses on my camera, any of which offer sharpness and color rendition that matches or exceeds that provided by even good prime lenses.  A good zoom gives versatility in terms of focal length, and I am not a purist in terms of equipment choice: I use what I feel to be the best tool for the circumstances I find myself in.  The only time I find a prime lens preferable is when I need to use a large aperture, and consequently such a lens' performance at large apertures becomes by far its most important quality. I was, unfortunately, very quickly disappointed with the Sigma's image quality.  After subsequent fiddling, both in regular use and in semi-formal "testing," to determine the reasons for the poor sharpness, I realized there were two separate issues contributing to its mediocre performance: first, it focused inconsistently.  This seems distinct from most focusing-related complaints here, as my copy didn't consistently front-focus or back-focus: those problems can apparently be fixed, at least on some samples.  This lens simply wasn't consistent enough in its focus to hit its depth of field at wide apertures, a rather critical failure for a fast lens.  Even among Nikkors, some lenses are better than others, and one big advantage of the newer AF-S Nikkors is that they tend to focus very consistently, if not always quickly: they will make the small adjustments necessary to keep the subject in sharp focus, even when depth of field is narrow, and they consequently provide a very large proportion of perfectly focused images.  The Sigma, at least my copy, was not able to do that. Second, exacerbating the focus issue, was a general lack of sharpness at large apertures even when focus was perfect.  Whether the subject was a simple test chart or a real-life target, the lens' sharpness was just not very good as the aperture widened past about f/4.  It was worst wide open, where I would characterize it as useable but fairly poor, and not, unfortunately, much better at f/1.8 or f/2.  F/2.8 was better, but still markedly soft, f/4 was fairly sharp but still not on the level I expect from today's high-quality lenses.  Along with the lack of sharpness at larger apertures came a lack of contrast - photos taken with this lens at f/1.8 were significantly less contrasty than those taken with the Nikkor 35/1.8, a typical side effect of poor sharpness as the colors run together within areas of fine detail, rather like a small-scale water color painting. Were these performance issues significant enough to be noticeable on normal-size prints?  At f/4, probably not.  At f/2.8, maybe.  However, there is no point, for me, in using a lens like this unless I can effectively use it at f/1.8 and below - and at those apertures, the lack of detail and contrast would keep me from using it except in shots where detail was simply not important - and yes, it would be noticeable even at ordinary print sizes, or displayed un-magnified on a computer monitor. My conclusion, then, was that the lens did not meet my basic personal requirements for image quality.  It does, however, have its good points, and in giving it a rating I consider it a three-star lens.  It is genuinely fast, and its f/1.4 aperture can allow one to capture images that would simply not be possible with other lenses.  It is reasonably sharp at ordinary apertures, and it is capable of producing colorful, contrasty images, the equal of even very good Nikkors - a probable testament to Sigma's use of high quality coatings.  Its build indeed appears very stout; and if its focus feel is the typically high-friction, gritty feel of modern internal-motor lenses, then at least the focus ring is well placed, accessible, and easy to use. A few miscellaneous comments that might be of importance to some users of this lens, and in particular some points of comparison to the 35/1.8 Nikkor: - The Sigma uses a 62mm filter thread.  This may be relatively Canon-friendly but is not a common size on modern Nikon gear.  Consequently a new lot of filters and step-up-rings would need to be purchased if I were to keep the lens, adding cost and bag clutter.  The Nikkor uses a very standard (for Nikon) 52mm filter. - The Sigma rear cap is infuriating in that it only goes on the lens in one orientation.  Every Nikon, Tokina, etc. lens I've used allows the cap to be put on in any of several orientations, and in comparison the Sigma cap is a pain in the neck to use.  The best option here might be to use a spare Nikon cap for the lens, or buy one if you don't already have an extra. - I would not describe the bokeh of the Sigma as excellent.  It is much better than most newer Nikon and Nikon-mount lenses, but that is primarily because most such lenses, unfortunately, have poor bokeh.  The Nikon 35/1.8 has poor bokeh.  The Sigma has what might appropriately be called "neutral" bokeh, in that the discs created on the image by out-of-focus point highlights have approximately even intensity of illumination across their diameters.  A lens that has bad bokeh will show bright rings at the edges of these discs, while a lens with excellent bokeh will show diminishing intensity from the center of these discs to the edge.  The latter allows all out-of-focus points to blur together gently, while the former creates hard edges on out-of-focus objects.  The Sigma is between these extremes. - Bokeh is of lesser importance in a "normal" lens than in a lens of longer focal length.  This is simply because the degree of blur attainable is less at smaller focal lengths.  The Nikkor and the Sigma can create approximately the same degree of blur (the Nikkor is 35mm, remember), but it is in most cases a subtle out-of-focus effect, not dramatic as it can be with longer or telephoto lenses.  Consequently the character of that blur - the bokeh - is less noticeable and therefore less important.  It is simply harder to generate unpleasant blur at 30mm/35mm than it is at longer focal lengths.  For this reason, I didn't find the Sigma's bokeh advantage to be particularly noticeable in my photography, even when using the lens at large apertures.  The exception to this rule is when the lens is used for close-range photography, in which case the background will be thrown well out of focus. - I prefer the Sigma's 30mm focal length to the Nikkor's 35mm.  To my eye, 35mm is just a bit long for a "normal" lens on DX, and I usually want a bit more working space than I'd like at 35mm.  In this respect I prefer the Sigma - although Nikon's 28mm f/2.8 is another, very inexpensive, alternative.

I bought this lens to have a fast standard lens for my E-300 and L1 - the price is fair and the build quality is excellent!  Best of all, the images are beautiful. Even wide open, I am just amazed by the clarity of the images and the overall 'luminance', particularly for skin-tones. I'm using this as a portrait lens now and I'm in love with it! I was anxious when I saw that Leica is releasing a 25mm Summilux later this summer - I am a huge fan of the Summilux 50mm and thought that I'd want the 25mm too, but this Sigma has made me very happy at half the price of the Leica. We'll see how they compare when the Leica is out, but this lens is definitely a keeper!

I purchased this lens after reading reviews, comparsions, and numerous rants about that and this brand. Thus far it is proving to be a worthy replacement to my venerable Canon 50 f/1.8. What I like most about the Sigma 30 is its capability of shooting in low light while maintaining sharpness. The inclusion of HSM and FTM is also a benefit whenever the lens decides to hunt. That being said, I'm extremely glad that I purchased it and recommend it highly.

At F/1.4 this lens looks better than my other fast Canon primes do at f/2.5.  Sharper, great contrast and color.  As has been mentioned before, depth of field at f/1.4 is VERY thin.  Unless someone has a bad copy, the only "softness" wide open is due to missed focus, not lens sharpness.  This lens is tack sharp wide open and gets even better by f/2.  At f/4 and above no lens is better in my opinion. AF is very accurate in low light, and fast on my Rebel XT. I have used the Canon 35mm f/1.4-L, and even at 100% viewing, I saw little if any difference.  The 35mm-L had slightly better corners (I think) wide open, but the Sigma was sharper in the center wide open with equal contrast and color.  But the Sigma is not weather-proofed, and not as big and heavy if you like that kind of thing. Build quality is a step above non-L Canon lenses. This lens is the perfect walk-around lens for the Canon XT or 20D, allowing good hand-held shutter speeds from dark interiors, bright daylight to night lighting.  The (equiv.) 48mm field of view makes for the perfect, fast, sharp "normal" prime capable of producing great 16x20 prints.

I'm an "advanced amateur", I've owned photo equipment for 30 years, digital cameras for about 10 years. I generally use a Nikon D200, but have a Nikon D40X as a backup camera. For the latter, I bought this lens. The Sigma 30MM F1.4 HSM lens is a good lens.  The build quality is very good,  the finish is well done, graphics are clear.  It's weight tells me it has few plastic parts. Due to HSM ("Hyper Sonic Motor") it will auto focus attached to my D40X, unlike all other auto-focus lenses except Nikon's AF-S line. Secondly, for a camera like the Nikon D40 or D40X, the characteristics of this lens make it the only game in town.  The highest utility of this lens is that one can use it indoors often without a flash due to it's speed (F1.4). This is meaningful 1) in a museum, 2)where a camera flash would bother the subject (animals, kids, grumpy old people, etc.), or 3) where a (reflective) glass panel separates the subject from the camera.  For the D40X, or any other dSLR without a camera motor to drive the lens focus, one can only purchase Nikon AF-S lenses; and Nikon does not currently offer a fast lens with this speed. Further, Nikon lenses are generally more expensive than Sigma offerings. I've read reviews (some below) that discuss the sharpness of the images from this lens. A point in response. . . one must remember that depth of field is dependent upon aperture, the larger the aperture (smaller F number), the narrower the depth of field will be. At F1.4, the resulting depth of field won't be as good as it would be at F1.8, F2.0, etc. In many situations, this would not matter anyway. Bottom line, I am very satisfied with the images from my D40X/Sigma HSM combination; in fact, its my third HSM lens for this particular camera.

This is a remarkable lens. At about 1/3 the price of the comparable 35/1.4L, the lens delivers sharp contrasty pictures throughout all apertures. Note, the center is sharp at 1.4, not sharp for 1.4. As some reviewers have noted, its main weakness is soft corners at extremely wide apertures. I don't consider that a liability since one typically uses the widest apertures to isolate the subject. The bokeh and color are ok, but not as impressive as the 50/1.4 or the L zooms. The main problem with this lens is QC. I got a copy that squeaked occasionally, and also had problems focussing consistently on objects further away than some distance. Sending the lens back to Sigma for calibration fixed the focussing issue perfectly. The squeaking is still there, but I understand from other users that it's normal, and in any case doesn't detract from the operation of the lens.

About 1300.00 cheaper than the Nikon 28mm f1.4 lens.  For the price this low light lens does well, capturing sharp images. My only concern is that other dealers list this lens as having a total of 5 yrs warranty (1 international, 4 USA).  There is NO mention of USA warranty with the lens I received. I contacted Amazon about this but have received no reply to date. Thus I question whether the lens I received was so-called grey market, which is disconcerting seeing I could have gotten same lens elsewhere with full warranty. This is something to be aware of - hopefully Amazon will respond to me. UPDATE:::: 5/4/06 -  Amazon is listed as a authorized dealer on the Sigma site so I assume Sigma lenses sold by Amazon have the USA warranty (4 years).

The closest Nikon equivalent, the recently-discontinued 28mm f/1.4, now goes for about two grand -- used. I have an arsenal of twelve lenses, nine of which are relatively fast Nikons. Two of the remaining ones are equally fast Sigmas, of which this 30mm f/1.4 is a favorite. It's not a Nikon, but the quality is very close, and at a fifth of the price, the well-built, generously-warranteed Sigma is not just a bargain but a great VALUE. I find that minor imperfections in a lens are irrelevant anyway in our day and age. It's easy to, with a few quick nips and tucks, make those shortcomings disappear in Photoshop. If you don't want to spend the time (I don't blame you), or if you don't have adequate Photoshop chops, do what I do: load the images into DxO Optics Pro and let that program automatically correct things like sharpness, pincushioning, vignetting, and chromatic abberation (purple and green fringing). When DxO is done with your images, it has all but obliterated the difference between a 200-dollar and a 1,500-dollar lens. The 30mm Sigma has few imperfections to begin with. Wide open, it IS a little bit softer than at an aperture of f/3.5 or higher, but hardly jarringly so (and besides, all really fast photo lenses I'm aware of display this characteristic). I photograph a lot of weddings and this is the lens I now start and end the day with. It's a great lens for photojournalistic shots of the bride getting ready (this usually takes place in relatively cramped quarters where the shades may be partially down); I often can't back up far enough with my Nikon f/1.4 50mm, so Sigma's fast semi-wideangle lens is a godsend. I can also take available-light party pictures with it until dusk has fallen. Autofocus-wise, the lens isn't 100% reliable, as it sometimes hunts for focus in low-light conditions, occasionally costing you a nice shot. But at this price, I'm willing to overlook that. I subtract a star mainly for the the stupid edge-pinch lens cap which is almost impossible to remove when the lens hood is on (I replaced it  with a 13-dollar Nikon center-pinch lens cap). The rear lens cap on both my Sigma lenses is also trickier to get on and off than the Nikon equivalent. That's annoying -- how hard can it be to design an easy-on, easy-off lens cap, especially when you can crib off of the original manufacturer' design? Finally, note that the M/AF switch pictured in the product photo is no longer part of the lens. That feature has apparently been removed. My copy, at least, lacks such a switch. Not that I miss it.

I got this lens about 1 month ago and I really like it. It is pretty soft at f/1.4, but does get much sharper from f/1.8 on which makes it still very useful in low light. I have not had any focus issues with my copy and it focuses accurately at any distance. I do wish it focused closer than 15.5 inches though. I do think that Sigma has some significant quality control issues though as I reported in my review of their 70mm f/2.8 macro I recently bought. I go the macro after this lens because I was happy with it. When I brought my macro lens to the service center, who also services Canon, Nikon and Tamron lenses and they told me that they get more Sigma by far than any other brand with service issues even with brand new lenses.

UPDATED INFORMATION as of 2/5/2013: ------------------------- The review below this update remains the same... but with two additional (important) details. I hope this helps: 1. I did start to experience some autofocus misses in low light after owning the lens for about 2 weeks. Nothing too bad, but worth mentioning. Sometime it front focused, sometimes back focused. It still worked fine 90% of the time. 2. SIGMA IS RELEASING A 2ND VERSION OF THIS LENS in what they are calling their ART product line (no I am not confusing this with the new Sigma 35mm f1.4). Basically the same thing as the current 30mm f1.4, but with better optics (can you believe that?), better autofocus, and in my personal opinion, much sexier than the existing design; it is much sleeker looking. I'm sure it will be more expensive but might be worth waiting for if you're not sure about the existing 30mm. I cound't find a pic on Sigma site but Canonrumors.com has a picture of it. If you don't feel safe using the links I posted below, just search google for Sigma 30mm f1.4 ART lens: The announcement was on Jan 29, 2013. SIGMA PRESS RELEASE: [...] Canonrumors.com info about it: [...] ------------------------- For about 13 months, I have been searching for a fast, prime lens between 24mm and 35mm. It needed to be fast and sharp. I kept going back and forth between several lenses and finally decided to take my chances with the Sigma. I just couldn't get over the fact that the Canon 28mm f1.8 was apparently very soft at 1.8. Several reviews said it sharpened up at 2.8, but I want something that was faster than that. I have a Canon 60D, which is a cropped-frame sensor DSLR. I currently own the 50mm f1.8, but wanted something wider with at least an f1.8 aperature. I also own the Canon 17-55mm f2.8 which is a superb lens, but it is heavy. And although the f2.8 aperature is nice, I wanted a standard prime equivalent that was even faster (and a bit lighter). I like to take indoor shots at night and I also wanted to play around with the huge aperature to create nice out-of-focus backgrounds. The 50mm f1.8 does this well, but it is just too narrow for people-shots indoors on my crop body. I read several reviews (read: all of the reviews on the Internet) for the Canon 28mm 1.8, and, just like the reviews for the Sigma 30mm 1.4, some people loved it, some hated it. It was actually a very difficult decision for me since everytime I read one positive review for either lens, I'd see another on that bashed it. The Canon 35mm f2 was another option, but didn't have the fast, quiet USM motor, and the new updated version of that lens just seems too expensive for what it is. Besides, I wanted f1.8 or better. I also researched the Canon 24mm f1.4L and the Canon 35mm f1.4L. I couldn't justify spending over $1300 on either of them. I'm sure they're nice, but... When my Sigma arrived in the mail, I immediately opened that package... did you know that Sigma lenses come with a lens hood and a padded zipper case? The only other lenses I looked at that come with either of these accessories are the expensive Canon L lenses. The Sigma lens is bigger and heavier than I thought it would be, but feels great on my camera. For comparison, the Canon 50mm 1.8 is 4.5 ounces, and the Sigma 30mm 1.4 is around 14.5 ounces. It feels and looks very solid. The black finish goes perfectly with my 60D. So, shooting performance: SHARPNESS: Awesomely sharp at f1.4, even sharper stopped down. I am a pixel peeper, it's at least as sharp as my 17-55mm f2.8 when comparing 100% crops. No test charts or DXO scores were reviewed; just real world, real human-eyeball-viewing tests. Everything looked great. AUTOFOCUS: Autofocus was dead on everytime. Several reviews stated that autofous can be off at times, but its been just as accurate and as fast as my Canon 17-55mm f2.8. And, that lens is very good at what it does. If you purchase the Sigma and find the focus to be off, call Sigma and they will calibrate your lens. CONTRAST: Like I said earlier, I haven't done much technical comparison, but I found myself doing double-takes for the first day or two at how nice the contrast and color looked on the back of the camera. The only other lens I do that with is the 70-200mm f4. QUALITY: Several reviews have stated that if you "get a good copy" you'll be very happy. I must have gotten the best one they ever made, or quality control has gotten much better. Either way, I ordered this lens online, so I didn't even have the opportunity to test it before purchasing. It's great. OVERALL SATISFACTION: 100% satisfied. One of the best lens purchases I've ever made. Why? The lens is awesome, fast and sharp. And relatively inexpensive. After testing and using this lens, and having experience with some of Canon's self proclaimed best lenses, I can easily say this lens would be priced at over $1000 if Canon were MSRP-ing this gem. And here are the other lenses I own: Canon 70-200mm f4L IS USM Canon 100mm f2.8L IS USM Canon 17-55mm f2.8 IS USM Tokina 11-16mm f2.8 Canon 50mm f1.8 Rokinon 8mm Fisheye So if you are familiar with any of these lenses, you know the comparison is legit. To summarize: A great lens for a great price. If you are thinking of buying it, go fo it! You shouldn't be disappointed. And if you are disappointed, just make sure that whoever you purchase it from has a good return policy. Thanks for reading!

Pros: Center and large aperture performance Standard field of view for APS-C cameras Build quality Value Cons: Poor corner performance Bottom Line: This lens is the perfect focal length for APS-C.  A 35mm lens on APS-C always seems not quite wide enough, and 28mm a little too wide.  This Sigma at 30mm (I measured it at 31mm) fits nicely in between.  It offers a large aperture for available light shooting, with excellent center performance wide open.  If the corners were better it would be perfect. I am using this lens for Pentax mount on my K-7 (note: the review page doesn't distinguish between lens mounts for this item).  Focus has been extremely accurate, even wide open.  I have no issue using any of the focus points.  I don't know if I was lucky and received a good sample or if the Pentax K-7's special focus sensor that adjusts focus accordingly to light type (tungsten, daylight, etc) makes an improvement, all I know is that it works well. For the Pentax mount the lens is screw drive and not HSM.  The downside is it doesn't offer full time manual/quick shift like other HSM lenses, and the focus ring turns during AF operation.  There is no manual/auto selector for Pentax mount like the image shows. Corner performance is acceptable for portraiture work and anything where corner sharpness is not critical.  One of the strengths of this lens is that it is good wide open, and rarely do you need excellent corner performance with the thin depth of field at f/1.4. In Pentax mount, there is also the SMCP 31mm f/1.8 Limited lens, which is certainly an optically superior lens at the corners, but comes in at nearly 3 times the price.  I would recommend this Sigma 30mm for those on a smaller budget.  I think some of the online reviews are overly harsh on this lens, as they are looking primarily at test chart data and not images produced with the lens.  I recommend this lens, and wish Canon and Nikon made something similar.

With my 30D, the first copy of the lens I got could not focus at all. It was always back focusing by several inches in short distance and at the extremely thin DOF at 1.4, that rendered the lens completely useless. 47st photo was courteous enough to exchange it for another copy - which exhibited the same behavior. I sent the lens to SIGMA for recalibration, and they corrected it and send it back to me within two weeks. Now the lens focuses more or less reliably - but definitely misses the focus some times, especially in low light, and that makes the pictures useless. But when the focus is right - it is very sharp at the center - and acceptable at the corners. I have several L lenses too, and the photos from this lens is comparable in sharpness and and contrast with the more expensive lenses. I like the build quality and feel of the lens too. Overall, recommended, but be prepared to send it to SIGMA for calibration.

Nice little lens, and I like how cute and small it is. I have found that it has a tough time in darker situations, trying to find focus, though it lets in enough light for strong images. I find it a little loud in focusing, but the images really are what I wanted: nice and shallow focus, so everything fades to soft blur in the background.  A nice portrait lens, or for intimate settings to capture cozy moods.  I haven't used it much indoors yet, but so far is doing alright, but I far prefer natural lighting of the outdoors. All in all, a strong little addition to the family.

This is the first review I've written on amazon or any other website other than seller-reviews on ebay, and I decided to write this only to make one thing clear to beginners  like myself...DO NOT LET PEOPLE WHO SIT IN FRONT OF THEIR COMPUTERS WHO ASSUME THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY TO CONFUSE THE HELL OUT OF YOU! The reviews that you read that address issues that require sending your lens and camera to the manufacturer, are written by those who have a vision that is better than a 20/20, if thats even possible. With that said, I do however understand that since everything is made in factories with machines, there will be a small percentage of products made that won't be up to par, but we're talking about a very small percentage, otherwise these companies would go out of business. So If you happen to get a lens that is malfunctioning, then you have the full right to send it back for a new one that works. That was my prelude and here are my thoughts on this lens.... CAUTION!!! BEWARE!!!!!! STOP!!!! HALT!!!!! IF YOU'RE A PRO THEN GO AND BE A PRO SOMEWHERE ELSE.....LEAVE US BEGINNERS ALONE AND LET US BE! YOU'RE RUINING THE EXPERIENCE OF A FIRST LENS PURCHASE FOR ALL THE DSLR VIRGINS OUT THERE. DONT BE A C.B AND GO CLEAN YOUR LENSES WITH YOUR $5000 CLEANING KIT AND LET US ENJOY OUR PURCHASE! FACTS: 1) My first DSLR and my first Lens purchase 2) I spent approx. 6 months researching my choice in camera and lens and educating myself before making a decision. 3) I worked hard for my money and I wanted the best for every dollar spent. Do not confuse this statement with the typical "You get what you pay for", because that carries a different connotation. 4) If you're a beginner like myself then do yourself a favor and google every single word you don't understand thats used in forums or with someone who's using photography lingo to impose their knowledge on you. If you're at a camera store then don't feel bad to ask the employee what something means. They'll gladly help you. (by camera store I dont mean Best Buy). 5) If you have a "Crop Camera" know that your image is cropped to a smaller size because of your camera's sensor, because you decided to go with an affordable camera as opposed to a 5D Mark II which is a full-frame camera like the ones used by film makers. It's not that your camera sucks but all it means is that to give you a 1:1 lens to camera ratio you would have to pay more for the technology...understand that you have to multiply all your camera compatible lenses by 1.6 (for canon) to get the actual "mm" you're getting. So this lens turns into a "48mm" lens. If you are curious why, then wikipedia has the info to inform you. 6) I wanted a lens close to a 50mm equivalent but got an even better 48mm out of this lens 7) I was stuck between this and a canon 28mm f1.8. After reading all the reviews and knowing that a faster lens (f1.4) would be better I went with the sigma. 8) I've owned this sigma lens for 5 days now. All I can say is...."It's Heavenly"! Life looks better through this lens. Get this lens and get as close as you can to your subject and allow your finger to press down on the shutter and capture life and its beauty with some amazing depth of field. 9) You hold this lens in your hand and you feel like you've bought a $2000 lens for 500 bucks. I have a smile on my face as i'm writing this stuff because I am soooo happy with my purchase. 10) I was extremely afraid to jump into my first lens purchase because unlike every other person who owns a dslr I didnt go with a kit zoom lens. I purchased the body and decided to go with a prime lens. I couldn't be happier. But then again I don't know how much happier I could be until I buy my next lens and then my next and then my next..... CONCLUSION: Purchasing a product, like a lens, online requires a buyer to be informed about the item. Go to a camera store and try this lens. Mount it on your camera and have a go at it. If you end up loving it, then buy it right then and there. If you see a benefit in purchasing it online then come home and buy it online. You cannot make a decision that you're confused about through the use of reviews, meaning that if you've read every line of b.s I've given you then it's about time you get your big ass off your chair, put something on, get in your car and head to a store and see this beautiful lens in person. I'm in love with it and I hope you fall in love with your's too. Good luck to you!

With the Nikon's 1.5x crop factor, you have the rough equivalent of the traditional 35mm format's 50mm 1.4, a great basic lens. The wide aperture means great low-light focusing performance, and a bright viewfinder. I use a D40, so HSM was an important feature. (The D40 will only autofocus with AF-S lenses, and HSM is Sigma's equivalent) The focus motor is perhaps a tad louder than the D40 kit lens, but not by any significant amount. I appreciate the included lens hood, but wish the lens cap was a center-pinch design. Wide aperture lenses can do shallow depth of field, which I like, but can make some think their lens isn't sharp. Even focus-recompose can sometimes shift the plane of focus enough. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this lens.

I won't go into the technical details of this lens but rather a history of this lens and how I finally got a focusing Sigma 30mm Canon 20D:  Initially, this lens was paired with my Canon 20D.  The first set would not focus correctly.  Using the Amazon refund policy, I attained a second set.  This one seemed to be focusing better but still had a tendency to front focus. Canon 40D:  Ironically, when I got a new body, the lens focusing abilities performed poorly; it front focused.  After doing some research and reading up on how others attained a good copy, I decided to go ahead and send in the lens for calibration.  I have read in forums that many have sent in their lens for calibration were disappointed.  However, those who sent in their lens WITH their camera were almost always happy with the result.  Therefore, I sent in my lens with my 40D body. Service and warranty:  The calibration process was extremely fast.  They recieved my package Thursday afternoon.  I called Sigma Friday afternoon to check up on the status.  I expected that they haven't even gotten around to my package yet.  However, I was notified that they had already calibrated and sent it back my way.  I received a tracking number and received it promptly afterwards.  The service was excellent.  The service was free of charge because the warranty covers the services.  The warranty for the EX line of lenses, which this lens falls under, has a 4 year total warranty. Result:  I was very surprised.  The whole time it was on the canon 20d, I thought that the lens was focusing perfectly.  However, when it came back calibrated, I finally found out what I was missing out on.  I can shoot at 1.4 with little hesitation.  It has gotten much better at focusing in dark rooms. Conclusion: Unfortunately, the truth is that there is a high probably that your copy of this lens may have focussing issues.  When I finally obtained a copy that works on my 20D, it turned out that it didn't work correctly with a new body (40D); there are no guarantees that this lens will work from one body to another.  There is a high level of uncertainty about the quality of this lens.  However, the service is quick for calibration and often no hassle.  If you want a crop sensor standard lens for a bargain, buy one with the possibility that you may need to get it calibrated.  It is really not a big deal.  Like many things in life, you have the choice to look at the cup half full.  Within a few days, I was able to enjoy a crop sensor standard prime lens that focuses fast and accurately. I know what the pushback is.  If you purchase a lens of this price and caliber, everything should work perfectly.  Largely, I am in total agreement with you.  Why should I dish out 500 dollars for something the may not work properly?  However,  keep in mind what your options are.  If you are a canon user, you have the choice of the 35L or a 24mm and 28mm, neither of which is f1.4 or close to 50mm.  If you are a canon user like me and unless you can afford the 35L, this is really your only choice for a fast and large aperture crop sensor standard.  This lens really is a bargain for what it is capable of, f1.4, equivalent 50mm (48mm actual) and a fast focusing motor (HSM). Buy it and cross your fingers. Be it that it should mis-focus, then get yourself a new copy but should the second copy do likewise, send it in for calibration with your body.  It's a small inconvenience but it will be worth your time. Thanks for reading

I had read that the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 lens for Canon Digital SLR cameras showed some difficulties in focusing on close-up objects, especially in low light conditions or with large f-stop settings. After purchasing this product for my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi in Nov. 06, I produced more than 1000 shots mostly in bright sunlight but also 50 in low light or near dark conditions.  The lens and camera performed flawlessly in all situations and produced some truly stunning results.

As of this writing this is the ONLY available "normal" focal length lens of this speed available for Nikon DX DSLR's. Fortunately, the optical performance of this superfast lens is excellent. Even wide open at f1.4 the sharpness and aberration control are admirably high. For indoor available light photography this is a real gem of a lens. The build quality is adequately high and the lens, while large, balances nicely on a DSLR body. The only problem here is that these lenses appear to suffer a painfully high rate of focusing errors upon purchase. My own copy front-focused quite significantly with both my D200 and D300 bodies (it was much worse with the latter).  I had to send the lens to Sigma in New York for recalibration. This required a couple of weeks and the expense of mailing the lens across the country, but in the end I had a lens that functions perfectly.  The apparent frequency of focusing issues with some Sigma lenses does make me a little reluctant to buy more from Sigma, frankly.  But I am happy with this lens now and I use it quite frequently.

I was 0 for 2 with the Sigma 30mm bought at Amazon. Got the first one, focus was terrible. I mean the only thing I could get in focus on my xti was a shot outside at f/8 and infinity. I tried to focus on my birdfeeder at 30 feet and was really blurry (with plenty of shutter speed). Inside was a little better but completely unacceptable compared to my 50mm f/1.8. Sent it back and got another from Amazon. A little better inside. The focus was not so horrible that I could actually tell that it was front focusing. Things that were in focus were very sharp (only a couple of shots of things I wasn't focusing on). Outside I still couldn't get a clear focus on the bird feeder. Oh well, Amazon was great though. No problems with the refund. Got my Canon 28mm f/1.8 (at B&H) and all of the tests that I did with the Sigma showed that the focus was right on. Taking pictures of my baby girl was hit or miss just like my nifty fifty, but at least I can take sharp pictures of inanimate objects at close and far ranges. Unfortunately, that was not possible with the Sigma 30s that I had tried (on my Xti).

Normally I am not a fan of sigma products, in general I find it worth the extra money to get a canon lens. The Sigma 30mm is the exception. I use this as my walk around lens for my rebel xti and couldn't be happier with the quality. Some very minor focus issues at close range or low-light conditions, but as it has already been mentioned nothing that can't be overcome by a little ingenuity. If you're looking for a good prime lens on par with canon for less money, this is the lens for you.

I had high hopes for this lens.  My 50mm f/1.8 nikkor is a great lens, but sometimes I just don't have enough room to get everything in the shot.  So I purchased the Sigma 30mm f/1.4, also being excited about the extra stop because I often take photos in low-light situations. I was aware that there were some defective copies of this lens, but thought that maybe I would get lucky.  Alas, no such luck.  My copy of the lens (like many others) had uneven apeture blades which caused the lens to over-expose my shots significantly.  I could have just dailed down my exposure value to compensate, but the problem, though it occurred frequently, wasn't 100% consistent. My copy of the lens was also unacceptably soft.  And I'm not really hung-up on getting super-sharp images. I returned the lens to 47th Street Photo.  They graciously charged me $65.00 for restocking (on top of the return shipping that I covered).  They were never very nice to me on the phone either.  I won't be ordering anything from 47th street photo again and I'll think twice about using Sigma products in the future, in spite of my complete satisfaction with my Sigma 10-20mm zoom.

If you own a Nikon D40/x and need a good AF-S low light lens under f/2, this is your only option (Nikon hasn't made a <f/2 lens for the D40/x yet).  I've been using the lens for a while now in all different types of situations - it's great for indoor or low light situations, but don't try to get too close to the subject (under 3 feet) as the focus won't be sharp enough.  The body is heavy and doesn't feel cheap.  I like it so far and am happy with the purchase.

I read all the reviews online and comments in this area for this lens and I decided to give it a shot.  It appears well built and connected quite securly to my t3i.  I was having difficulty with a bit of front focusing on my first copy but I decided to give it a long trial period.  Well I went out on a shoot and found that at key moments (when I wanted to focus on a ring) it would put other things in focus and not where I had actually locked focus on.  I did the tests and found while it was front focusing a bit it wasn't nearly as bad as some peoples are.  In fact i believe I have a photo of my test in there.  Mine is the more accurate one where I say, "I guess I have a good copy"  that was posted before I did my shoot and just using those tests. EDIT 5-9-12 After the shoot I immediately asked Amazon for a replacement because it has to get better?!  Just got done talking with amazon customer service and they are now sending me out a THIRD COPY....  the replacement #1 was even worse! now i see the huge issues people are talking about.  Every Apeture was soft, way more blurry then my first copy (its a shame i let it go).  Now i am waiting for replacement #2 to arrive tomorrow when i hope it will work better.  after this STRIKE THREE they are out... full refund and just hope that the canon EF-28 F/1.8 goes to Prime sooner than later EDIT 5-10-12 Third strike... failed focus test by 20mm front focusing, while my Canon 85mm and 50mm both nailed it.  Also, I am guessing this could be a former return as the rear lens cap says CANON!!!!! oh well i am returning this one as well and getting my money back.  I really wanted to love this lens, it was the perfect range.

Updating my original review since receiving my new copy of the lens.  For those wondering, my review has jumped from 1 Star to 4.  This piece of glass is THAT nice. I spent two days putting this lens through the ringer shooting stills and video of a group golf outing, rehearsal/dinner, and the wedding the following day.  Shot the majority of the images between 4.0 and 8.0 - anything larger was overexposed in the bright sun. The low light images shot between 1.4 and 2.8 are beautiful, some softness in the corners but I tend to shoot portraits with my primes at wide apertures and very rarely are those faces in the corners! For the major focus issue I had in the first lens I received, the focus on this lens is fast and accurate.  In fact, I would say the focus is more accurate than my Canon 50mm 1.4 (which, btw, I may not ever use again until I buy a full frame camera). So in summary, I will leave my original review below because it is a significant issue that consumers should be aware of but the new lens I received is so incredible I felt the need to edit my review. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Labored over whether I should buy this Sigma 30mm or the Canon 28mm 1.8 for weeks. Ultimately decided to ignore the negative reviews questioning Sigma's quality control.  I wish I had listened. The AF on the lens does not function at all. Not front or back focusing, just NOT focusing. I mean, c'mon, how does that lens ever get shipped from the factory like that? This is all compounded by the fact that the box has some wear and tear. I must not be the first to open and return this item. You're better than this, Amazon.

I would like to start off by saying that I use Primarily Canon L lenses but this was my first true love. I recently upgraded to the Canon 35mm 1.4L because I am planning on moving to a full frame body and the Sigma does NOT work on FF The First few days I did a shootout between the 2 lenses and I can assure the differences in IQ (Image Quality) are minimal at best! This was and still IS one of my favorite lenses that I have ever used! I recommend this lens to EVERYBODY! I hope this review helps you to decide to buy this lens because it truly is amazing!

The Sigma 30mm 1.4f is the lens that hits the sweet spot on focal length, aperture and price. This lens was made to fit a cropped sensor like the Canon T2i (550d) Digital SLR body. The cropped sensor is 1.6x, so 30mm x 1.6 = 48mm equivalent on a full frame 35mm sensor like the Canon 5D Mark II. Because 48mm is very close to the natural focal length of the human eye (50mm) it is the perfect lens that is easy to work with on film and stills. I was looking for a movie lens for my Canon T2i that would have a nice wide aperture for incredible depth-of-field that cinema cameras have. I was really going for the Canon 1.4f or the 1.8f 50mm lens because of the popularity and the price. However, I soon discovered that these lenses were made almost 20 years ago, and were made for full frame sensors. If I put a 50mm lens on my T2i, it would become an 80mm lens. This bothered me because I would have to move the camera farther away from the actors and would result in lower sound quality. Also, because cinematic movies are cropped again, it's best to give your subject lots of free space around the frame because their head might get cut off. After researching videos on YouTube and [...]and some other lens review sites, I found that the Sigma 30mm was the lens I was looking for. Although it was not in my price range and more expensive than the Canon 50mm 1.4 lens, I wanted a lens that I wouldn't have to upgrade to get that perfect human eye focal length, and also because of the crop factor. The Sigma lens was introduced into the market half a decade ago because no lens manufacturer had really filled this niche for DSLRs with a cropped sensor. Canon has lens that are 28mm and 35mm, but are quite expensive, considering that they were L (luxury) series lenses. This lens was the best bang for the buck. As an emerging filmmaker, I wanted to upgrade from my kit lens which was the Canon 18-55mm 3.5/5.6f lens. I knew that most people would complement this lens with a telephoto zoom lens for less than $200, but what will that benefit me for filmmaking? Also, most lenses out there are zoom lenses. However, zoom lenses have higher apertures, and won't really give me a good DOF. That is why I just went for a prime lens instead of a zoom lens. In filmmaking, light is always a problem especially for low-budget films. However, this lens will just "gobble light up". You don't have to sacrifice ISO and slow shutter speeds anymore with this wide aperture lens. Now if you are going to get this lens, here are some things I discovered: Auto Focus - It's a problem that plagues all lenses that have a wide aperture because the DOF is super shallow, and the camera will have a hard time to discern what it should focus on. If you want a sharper image, you can stop down to 2.0 and will be much more adequate for shaper photos. If you are using this lens for video, you won't really notice how sharp it is. However, if you really want a super sharp photo, this lens won't be what you are looking for. Full-time Auto Focus - You can override auto focus if you decide to focus on something else without switch the mode to manual. It's not a kit lens - It is professional lens (EX) that is completely made metal and glass. On my T2i (which is a plastic body), you can feel the difference in weight! It comes with a case and a lens hood! Make sure you get a UV lens filter. I got the Sunpak 62mm UV Filter. It's cheap but durable. If you haven't upgraded your audio, you should look for the RODE Shotgun VideoMic (which is Mono) or the RODE Stereo VideoMic SVM. These microphones by RODE are professional quality mics that are specifically made for camcorders and DSLRs that capture film. Both of them have a hotshoe mount and use the 3.5mm audio minijack that can plug into your DSLR's mic in. However, if you want to use professional equipment that uses XLR jacks, you will need to get an audio recorder like the ZOOM H4N. Hope that helps! Thanks for reading!

I just requested a return from Amazon for this lens.  As always, Amazon rocks. Here's my two day experience with it attached to my Canon T1i: I bought this lens wanting more light/speed and a more natural focal length compared to my Canon 50mm 1.8 (cropped sensor).  Like most, I read tons of reviews and forum entries around this lens before purchasing.  I was a little anxious when I first received it due to all the mixed reviews out on the web.  I bought it knowing there was a chance I'd get a bad copy. Everything about the packaging, exterior, weight, fit and finish of this lens is excellent.  It just feels like a quality product during first impression.  The included case is nice, the hood fits well, the lens connects snugly to the camera with a snap of confidence.  The focus ring is nicely sized and has a proper amount of resistance. The optics of this lens are impressive.  The 2/3 extra stop compared to the Canon 50mm 1.8 will instantly spoil anyone.  The reduced focal length was also fantastic.  I shot my kids in my living room at night with a single light source in the room and was able to take great shots at ISO 400.  The bokeh is beautiful. I processed the first batch of raw images and noticed some missed shots from overall softness.  Some were tack sharp and others weren't.  I know with this DoF any slight change in distance from the target will cause this.  There was also some distortion and vignetting, but nothing major.  Other than that, the images were everything I had hoped from this lens. As I continued shooting, I noticed more and more soft images.  I think this got progressively worse over time as I used it.  I tried out manually focusing and realized this lens wasn't auto focusing correctly.  The manually focused shots were remarkable.  I confirmed the lens was front focusing using a tripod and focus chart.  This was very disappointing.  I really hoped to get a good copy of this lens. The second day I used it, the autofocus completely failed.  My guess is the HSM stripped or something.  As I was using the lens, the focus system stopped working and I was unable to take any more shots.  I was able to keep turning the focus ring without it ever stopping.  So that was it... I'm one of the unlucky ones to get a bad copy.  I can understand how there are so many mixed reviews on this lens.  When it worked and focused correctly, it was awesome for the price. I think I'm going to save up and get a Canon 35mm 1.4L. EDIT: I decided to request a replacement instead of refund and tried out a 2nd copy of this lens.  I got lucky and it was remarkably better than the 1st copy I received.  This one is a keeper and I'm happy it only took one extra try to get a good one.

If you have a 1.6 crop Canon EOS camera, this is a good pick for a prime lens. The images have a natural, smooth (not "soft" but smooth) look, with shallow depth of field when shot wide open. It renders colors beautifully, has excellent contrast and only mild chromatic aberration. But this comes with a warning, a big one: this lens is not for every Canon camera. Sigma's quality control is notorious, and I'm sure this is not the only review you'll read that mentions the lens doesn't focus properly. I would only recommend this if you have a Canon EOS 7D or 50D. Those two cameras have built-in AF microadjustment. The 60D does not and as far as I know the Rebels do not. Out of the box, I saw the lens was VERY front-focused using a 7D. I had to go into my camera's menu and find the AF microadjustment (shortcut: it's in the Custom Function menu, C. Fn. III Autofocus/Drive) and adjust the maximum amount, 20 clicks. If this lens was any more out of adjustment, it would be beyond the camera's ability to correct it! So I can only recommend this lens if you have a Canon 50D or 7D. If you have any other camera, you're taking a gamble that you will need to return this lens after you test it, and hope that your next one is a better copy. I wish Sigma had better quality control, as the actual lens formula is a sweet one that produces a beautiful look. But so many copies of this lens are so out of whack, right out of the box, and that should give pause to any buyer. Sigma has been making this lens for years, and they haven't fixed their QC issues with it. That being said, now that my camera has been adjusted for the lens' shortcomings, I'm very happy with the images it produces. It's far better than my original Canon "nifty fifty." Like all Sigma lenses I've tried, the lens makes more noise than Canon glass does when focusing. It's quiet, but more noticeable than Canon. Shooting stills, I don't care. But if I were shooting video I might be concerned. Bottom line, it's a very good lens if you have a camera that can make up for its quality control failings (the 7D or the 50D). Buying this for any other Canon as of this writing is taking a gamble. I'd give it four or five stars if I knew that every one focused accurately out of the box.

FYI I just got my Sigma 30mm f/1.4 today. Everything's GREAT about it and it's like shooting film with 50mm again on a APS-C camera. I love lens. Color contrast etc looked GREAT. Bokeh is soft and beautiful (soft & creamy, not donut shaped, not harsh). However, it's got one serious flaw, one that's well reported on Amazon's review-- focus problem. Auto focus system tends to focus in front (like myopic) so whatever I'm aiming at is blurred. It's really GREAT in manual focus mode, but unusable in AF. Apparently, many people have had to send the lens to Sigma back for recalibration. I returned my severely front-focused copy, then got a second copy with a slight front-focus problem (at 2 feet away, misses focus by about an inch). This time, I just sent it to Sigma Service Center in Arizona and they re-calibrated it in about a week. It came back PERFECTLY! With perfect focus, even at night time, I've now made this my #1 lens to use at night time. The bokeh from this lens is amazing, and still way better than the new Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G that I tried (but didn't buy). The differences between the two is this, and you should try it out especially at night time, because night bokeh is how you really test how good the lens blur is: Sigma's bokeh is soft and creamy. Nikon's bokeh has a well defined donut shape, too well defined. Sure the Nikkor is slightly sharper when wide open, but at f/2.0 and beyond, the Sigma 30mm is the queen (Sigma 50mm is the king, and I will have another review on that as well). Don't get me wrong, the Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G is still nice to use. It is sharp, moderately fast, and during day time you're not going to notice much differences in bokeh (since the background is light and gets mushed together). However, at night time, the Sigma 30mm is THE lens to use because bokeh is soft and creamy, whereas the Nikkor gives out a really noticeable donut ring. If you prefer the donut look, then the Nikkor 35mm is a bargain at 1/2 the cost of a Sigma. But most of the pixel-peepers I talk to prefer the Sigma soft bokeh by a large margin. I originally gave this lens 3 stars only because I've NEVER in my life had to send a lens back, and considering how common this problem is, I'm surprised Sigma hasn't done the responsible thing even after releasing this lens for a while-- recall and better quality control. However, the image quality is so amazing, that I would be willing to change it to 4 stars if only Amazon lets me do it.

This is a very nice lens.  I questioned whether I needed a fixed length lens, but this is very good for learning how to shoot, and very good for low light situations like museums or indoors.  I have several zoom and wide angle lenses and this lens fit a niche the others don't.  Pictures are crisp, sharp and vibrant.

The sigma 30 1.4 is hands down the best lens at this price point.  Having owned the lens for about 6 months, I can say I have no complaints.  I would rate the build quality at 8 out of 10.  It is a very solid lens, but a metal body would have been nice.  However, I wasn't expecting metal at this price point. The image quality is absolutely fantastic.  The bokeh this lens produces is buttery smooth.  Images are tack sharp at 1.8 and above.  There is VERY slight softness at 1.4 but nothing that can not be fixed with a little PP.  Many people say it is not sharp at 1.4, but take that with a grain of salt because at 1.4 this lens has a very thin DOF and can be hard to focus 100% accurately.  Practice makes perfect and you will get the hang of it after a few weeks time. You will hear a lot of about focus issues with this lens, but it is not as bad as people make it out.  My copy did need a +5 in the custom menu for MFA.  The issues are not as widespread as people make it sound.  Sigma will also adjust this lens for free if you purchase it and find an issue.  Honestly, it is a very small price you have to pay for the quality that this lens has the ability to produce. Without a doubt, buy this lens if you are looking for a 50mm FOV equivalent for 1.6x crop.

If you want to shoot in low available light, indoors, on a budget with a crop sensor camera the Sigma 30mm is a superstar.  Ideal for parents with a newborn, where you don't want to crank up the lights or flash the little one. One warning though, you may get addicted to shooting with this lens wide open, rendering wildly blurred backgrounds around sharp images.  Then you may want other "fast glass", but you'll find very few bargains of this magnitude available. If you search around you will likely find more than a few people complaining about focus issues with this lens.  I've owned two of them, with no issues, but I suppose I do believe they are more likely to not be spot on than some other lenses.  The great thing is that Sigma provides a six year warranty (unlike 1 with Canon), so you don't have much to worry about beyond the hassle of a return if your new lens is not as good as expected.

This 30mm lens translates to a 48mm on a modern Canon "cropped sensor" camera, so it's a perfect replacement for the 50mm on your old film camera.  The light-gathering and sharpness of this lens are fantastic!  You'll find yourself not needing a flash in most indoor shots, which is great! The only problem I have with this lens is that you won't be able to use it on a full-frame camera, if you ever get one, as it's only made for the "cropped-sensor" cameras.  However, for an f/1.4 lens, the price is great! Now get one of the Canon 50mm lenses for portraits:  Either the f/1.2L or the f/1.4 or the f/1.8 (the Nifty Fifty).  An alternative, which is placed in quality between the f/1.2L and the f/1.4 Canon lenses, is the Sigma 50mm f/1.4 EX.  Quality will be better than the f/1.4 Canon, and the pricing should be fairly close. Then the 16-35L and the 70-200 f/4L and your collection should take care of just about any circumstance! I'm a huge Canon L lens fan, but this is one of the lenses I make an exception for.  It's one of my favorite lenses!  A great introductory lens for someone who has never experienced anything below f/3.5.  Plus, it looks beautiful on your camera (see the picture of the Rebel XT with the lens attached). <update>  I've seen photos people have taken with this lens attached to a 5D, which is a full-frame camera, and the vignetting may be acceptable to many people, so I withdraw my previous statement that this lens cannot be used with a full-frame camera.  However, the Sigma DC-series lenses are specifically made for "crop-sensor" cameras and may have unacceptable vignetting on a full-frame camera (for most people).  FYI:  The EX in the name means it's built with a higher standard of quality than the regular Sigma lenses.  I can't stress enough how great the build quality of this lens is!

I bought this lens for my Olympus E-510. It's quite substantial and feels well made, but it feels well balanced well with the Olympus body and is very comfortable to work with. The lens focusses very quickly - presumably this is the Sigma HSM in action. In low light the wide aperture certainly improves the brightness of the viewfinder in these smaller Olympus SLRs. Interestingly, Sigma included a note with my lens telling me that one should select Autofocus or Manual focus on both the lens and the camera, but even then one cannot overriden Autofocus with Manual focussing. However, on the E-510 I have had no problem at all overriding Autofocus by simply holding shutter release halfway while manually adjusting focus. I wonder if the latest firmware upgrade has brought this improvement. I doubt it - I expect that Sigma are referring instead to the published 4/3 standard and that, in practice, Olympus enables a more flexible approach. The manual override is certainly useful in low light, when even the fast lens does not enable Autofocus to do its thing. And the results? I'm more than happy. Even wide open, the lens is sharp. Certainly for anyone currently using the Olympus kit lenses you'll feel no difference in quality with this lens. Indeed at f8/f11 it's marginally sharper than the kit Zuikos, I think. The slight telephoto angle is great for candid shots - not as tight as a real portrait lens, but just long enough frame the subject more tightly than with a traditional 50mm standard lens. In short (or in slight telephoto, if you prefer) this is a winner. I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it. And finally ... I can hardly wait to try this with the EP-1.

I just got mine today. No poor focusing problems mentioned by others. I tested it around the house and on a chart as well. No back or front focusing either. The lens appears very sharp. The lens is about $30 cheaper than anywhere else here on amazon. I'd reccomend it, but you might have to go through a couple of copies judging by all the other reviews.

Just bought this lens a week ago from 47 St Phot, the service is good and delivered fast but the Sigma Lens itself had problem. I took at least 500 test shots at low lights (I tested at F/1.4/1.6/1.8 to F/2.8, ISO from 200 to 1600) on my D90. Auto focus is very inconsistant, most of the time, front or rear focusing(I layout a newspaper with an angle and mark a circle as my focus point), sometimes it kept focusing without lock(motor keeps running). I tried different focus modes(Single/Center/Multiple/3D..) on my D90, none of them works right. The manual focus is bad also and it only works by taking pictures from LiveView(LCD) not from the viewfinder. What I saw in the viewfinder is not what I will get. When I saw clear in the viewfinder, will produce very blur picture on LCD after zoomed. Before I returned, I gave a chance and took some pictures again, still disappointed. I kept swapping Nikon(18-55mm) and this sigma 30mm f/1.4 lens, even Nikon 18mm at f3.5 with much lower shutter speed will produce much better pictures than this fast f1.4 lens. After returned that lens, I ordered Nikon 35mm f/2.0 and received today, no comparison, shot-after-shot, not miss a single, the Nikon 35mm f/2.0 is a very consistant, very fast focusing, and very accurate lens. The sigma lens can only produce the same quality of pictures by luck, which I mean less than 10%. So I recommend just buy Nikon 35mm f/2.0 lens, even it's half slower, it will produce much better pictures.  BTW, the Nikon f2D lens works exact the same as the G lens at A(aperture priority) mode on my D90.

Great Lens for Video DSLR's with a Crop Sensor (1.6x) I own a Canon T2i and was looking for that one lens that would closely mimic the Canon 50mm f1.4 but on a Crop Sensor camera. This Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens is it!  If you have a crop sensor DSLR and are looking to shoot high-quality video then this is the lens. Build Quality: 10/10  --- This thing is solid, weighs about as much as my camera, has a nice metal feel to it. The lens cap could be higher quality but that's not what I'm buying the thing for. Video Quality: 9/10  --- This Lens produces some very sharp video images, even at f1.4, it looks great. "The edges aren't as sharp" is what I've heard from other reviews, but for Video use and my needs it looks fantastic. The lens at f1.4 can see in the dark, which is fantastic. Just be sure to have some way of limiting the light intake when outdoors if you want to keep that nice open f-stop. All Around:  9/10 --- For a non-name brand lens this thing is solid as anything, looks great, feels great to use and has really impressed me. This can easily compete with some of the namebrand Canon Lenses out there. If You are looking for that 50mm f1.4 equivalent lens for your crop sensor Camera, this is it. for a video review check out my review on YouTube:  [...]

I purchased this lens to replace my Nikon 50mm f/1.8 prime.  While the Nikon lens was fine, the lack of autofocus made it too challenging to take photos of dancers or musicians in low light (my primary use for the lens).  With this Sigma 30 mm on my Nikon D40 (effectively a 45 mm lens on this camera due to the sensor size) not only do I get a faster lens (wider aperture) but I get autofocus due to Sigma's HSM.  My early  results (links below) have been good, with no problems. PROS: fast, great depth of field range, very sharp images, autofocus on D40 CONS: heavy on D40 body, 62mm filters means none of my existing 52mm filters fit Links to samples: [...] [...]

There is such hullabaloo about this lens - focus problems, soft corners, no clarity at 1.4 - that I was apprehensive when I bought it. Perhaps Sigma has a problem with quality control - I can't confirm that, because the copy I received from Amazon.com performs perfectly. In a nutshell, if you shoot a crop-sensor DSLR and want a 'standard' focal length lens that can shoot in low-light situations, this lens is hard to beat.  Compared to Canon's 28mm f1.8, there is no contest.  The Canon is soft - at all apertures.  The Sigma is a tad soft at 1.4, but very usable. From 2.0 on, it is spot on.  Focusing problems? I haven't noticed any. I have used this lens at twilight, when I could not see to focus manually, and it nailed the focus quickly. I have not experienced any front-focusing at all. Corners not sharp?  I have no idea. My photography never involves test patterns, so who knows?  What I am shooting is sharp. At $500, this lens is not cheap, but for what it does, it's a bargain.

I had very high hopes for this lens. And, out of the box, beatifully constructed. Unfortunately, it front focuses repeatedly. This is a known problem with some sigma 35/camera combo's. See the reviews on photo.net The body used was a d90. I emailed sigma-they offered to calibrate it, AFTER I filled out the warranty. Meaning I could not return it. If they were unable to calibrate it, I could not return it. Not a risk I wanted to take. I really wanted this lens to work-but it had to go back. If you get a good copy, great. Still, I expect it to work as advertised out of the box. (I had the opposite experience with a Tokina 11-16. There are also some bad copies, apparently, floating around. But mine is excellent. Sharp focus and corners quite sharp wide open.) Since Amazon has a solid return policy, you can order one. If it works well for your body, great. If not, it's only a minor inconvenience to return it.

Just like many of the other reviews here, my lens had the auto-focus problem while being used on the Nikon D40X.  Kind of a bummer that right out of the box I had to send it back, to Sigma to recalibrate a new and 1st time used product.  To Sigmas credit, they fixed the problem and DHL'ed it back in a day or so.  The lens works great.  I would have prefered no hassles and no shipping fees to send to the manufacturer.

I wanted to love this lens. Sadly, it simply doesn't perform well. The focus issues with this lens have been written about ad nauseum, but I found that the focus issues manifested themselves differently than what I'd read here. It's not that the lens doesn't focus - it's that it focuses on the wrong thing. I was shooting this lens on a D40, which has five-point autofocus. I shot a series of engagement pictures entirely with this lens, and I used this lens heavily for a wedding. The amount of light that you get with an f/1.4 is incredible, and was a lifesaver in a dimly-lit church, but I lost dozens and dozens of shots because they were slightly out of focus. The lens would claim to be focused on one point, but would have focused ever so slightly on something just out of the bracket. The result is hard to tell on camera during the shoot, but unmistakable when viewing the pictures full-size. Furthermore, this lens has NO manual focus override. You can't grab the focus ring, and there's no switch. The only thing you can do is use the AF lock on your camera. If all you are doing is still portrait work in which you have careful and controlled handling of your subject, this lens is superb. Portraits are beautiful with it, and I found the bokeh to be very pleasing. The shots that *were* in focus are colorful, well-lit, superb pictures. Ultimately, though, this lens isn't versatile enough due to the focusing issues. It's too bad - Sigma nearly hit a home run with this one. If you're considering this lens and have read all the reviews as I did, please hear me on this: The focusing issues *are* a problem, and they *will* cause you to lose pictures. It's not a matter of, as I thought, some people not knowing how to use the lens. The lens has focusing issues, plain and simple. I guess I'll try the new Nikon 50mm f/1.4, although I sure wish it was the wider 30mm of this lens. So close, but so far.

This lens is everything I thought it would be! The 1.4 f-stop makes it good for low light situations. It also makes great bokeh. I use it mostly for portraiture, but it seems to stay on my camera most of the time. The only way to improve this lens is to make it have macro capabilities. Other than that, your getting a fast , bright lens!

this is, easily, my favorite lens for walking around. everything from the build-quality to the optics and the little extras they include in the box make this a really solid buy.

If you're looking for a good lens for shooting video... THIS IS IT!  Given that when shooting video in dimly lit environments you will need a wide aperture, this lens is perfect.  The 30mm viewing angle relates closely to a 50mm lens (35mm film camera) once the image is cropped.  This gives a natural viewing aspect.  Also, if you're shooting video it is a necessity to do all your focusing manually.  This makes the autofocus issues really become not a problem.  My camera (t2i) doesn't have the best autofocus as it is, but if you choose live view (quick focus) it focuses optically instead of trying to sense the object's range.  This makes any autofocus issues basically disappear when taking photographs.  The f/1.4 aperture makes it possible to take pictures without a flash almost anywhere!  This allows for beautifully colored and wonderful naturally lit photos.  I noticed some slight noise when the aperture adjusts from the grinding of the aperture blades, but you should use manual exposure for video anyways so that you don't get jumps of brightness or darkness in your videos when you're aperture jumps. Overall this lens will open up a world of photographic and video-graphic possibilities.  I would highly recommend this lens! Since you're not using any zoom you can focus on using manual focus and really open up your creativity!  set your aperture on 1.4 and your shutter on 1/60 (the slowest speed without getting camera shake), then put your ISO on auto and shoot.  You can get beautiful pictures in a snap in nearly any lighting environment!  Don't be afraid to use manual focus! Get this lens!  The wide aperture and quality optics make this lens a good buy.

This lens was purchased for my 40D.  When I received this lens I was floored with the quality and the value from Sigma.  Not only does the lens come with a storage case for the lens, it arrives with a very nice hood.  These two features are something you pay extra for with a Canon lens. The lens is extremely sharp at f/1.6+, f/1.4 has such a short depth of field that achieving sharpness can be somewhat difficult at times.  I have found that f/4 and above achieves a uniform sharpness on the whole picture, but I shoot at f/1.4-f/1.6 primarily.  This lens is an excellent low light/indoors lens, which is the reason I have it attached to my camera at all times. The auto focus is near silent, extremely fast.  The lens rarely has trouble focusing.  The only time I have noticed a problem with focus is in very low light, but those problems account for at most 2-5% of my shots, nothing to worry about.  The lens cannot focus closer than a foot, foot and a half, but that's to be expected. This lens was purchased for my crop body camera, and is equivalent to ~50mm on a full frame sensor.  I had looked at the 50mm f/1.4 Canon lens, but using it with a crop body means it turns out to be ~80mm, much too long of a lens for indoor shooting. The only other option I had was a 28mm Canon. Am I happy I purchased this lens over the 28mm Canon? Yes!  I recommend this lens to anyone with a crop body.  If you are starting out with a DSLR, this should be your first lens.  If you want to save money and get a lens comparable to the Canon equivalent, buy this lens. BUY THIS LENS!

I did a lot of research befpre buying this lens, and all my research only compelled me to not buy this lens as many people had experienced severe front and back focus problems with this lens, however I still decided to go ahead buy the lens as I wanted to experience the lens for myself before making any decisions. My first impressions were very good, but as soon as I started testing the lens, I noticed that the lens had a front focus problem, especially wide open, but this didn't go away completely even when closed down to F2.0. I've taken some great sharp shots with this lens, but the focus is very hit or miss. Also, the focus isn't as fast I had expected even with the large aperture. In face the lens struggles to focus in low light even in scenarios where my 14-42mm F3.5-5.6 lens focuses relatively quickly. Pros: Fast lens, very sharp, very accurate distance meter, excellent build quality. Cons: Front focus issues, slow AF, lack of macro support makes shooting at wide open very hard.

I have only been into digital SLR photography for a few months now but I have found this lens to be an excellent value and would highly recommend it to others.  Due to the large aperture of this lens (f/1.4) I am able to take excellent photographs in very low light conditions with fairly low shutter speeds which avoids most blurring of shots due to movement of the subjects (this is the reason I purchased an f/1.4 lens).  The lens focuses very quickly in most situations (it seems to be better than the kit lenses that came with my Olympus E-Volt 510 DSLR).  I also like the true mechanical manual focus on this lens over the Olympus kit lens's motor driven manual focus.

Wow...if only I had known to get this lens back in 2007 when I first got my Rebel XT. It's exactly what I've always needed.  The focal length is ideal. (almost precisely the same as the human eye...what I see, is what the photo looks like) The large aperture is awesome- great for indoor photos. (I'm able to take photos in dim light at only 200-400 ISO.) Great background blur. The autofocus is quiet. Really, I don't have anything bad to say about it. Prior to this lens, I had the kit (18-55) and the 50mm 1.8 (I also recently purchased the Tamron 17-50 2.8...which I love, except for the noisy autofocus).  I've already sold the kit lens, and most likely will sell the 50 1.8 as well. This is just so much better for the crop-sensor camera-- 50mm was way too close/long for 90% of the shots I wanted. I know the 50mm 1.8 is cheap, but I do think the extra $300 for this lens is worth it. (Though really, it shouldn't be quite so expensive...I feel like a more reasonable price would be $350, rather than the $489 it's currently listed as). Anyway, if you're in doubt, just test one out. You'll probably love it.

I purchased this lens for indoor shots.  Because of the faster speed I chose it over the Sony f2.8 28mm lens.  The Sigma is about twice as heavy, which may be a factor if you travel a lot.  Also, the Sony is about $160 cheaper.  So these two lenses are in close competition and which one you pick will depend on what you want.  I have taken it out about 3 times now.  Once to catch a recent snowfall, once to photograph an elk herd and once on some waterfalls.  The Sigma takes fine clear shots and worked well in a variety of situations, both handheld and on a tripod.  It seems to autofocus quite rapidly and feel very solid in the hand.  At those times, I took my friend's Sony 28 and those pics were good too.  I also took some indoor test shots with the Sigma and appreciated the faster lens speed.  If you are willing to pay the difference for the ability to take better indoor shots consider the Sigma, but if that isn't important to you the Sony would be a viable option.

What a fantastic lens! I've always used sharpest lenses (17-55 f/2.8, 50 f/1.4 etc). This lens is not only super sharp, but it's like the best L-lenses: it gives superb micro-contrast, bokeh, color and realism. I use it on my 40D with a Kenko Pro1 UV filter. My favorite apertures are f/2.8 to f/5.6. But, f/1.4-2 are not bad either if there is not sufficient light. The Sigma AF is not as reliable as Canon ones. My 30mm doesn't front- or back-focus consistently, but AF can miss focus at times, especially if you use it at f/1.4. My favorite zoom is 17-55 f/2.8. I wouldn't leave home only with 50mm, 85mm primes, but 30mm is much more versatile than those primes and I don't hesitate to use bring lens as my only lens to an event or a trip. 30mm is quite appropriate for portraits, but if you want the ultimate portrait lens, I would recommend Canon 50mm f/1.4 (or f/1.2L).

I used this lens on my XTi with good results. After upgrading to a 40D, many of my shots were not focused properly. I thought it was the camera but it (apparently) was not. The lens is great from f4 to f16. But from f1.4 to f2.8 the images were not sharp. This was with careful testing using tripod, focus charts, remote shutter release, etc. It's not my failure to understand depth of field. I returned the lens.

This is a great lens, and exactly wanted I needed with my new rebel T2i. I've been a tradational 35mm shooter, untill this year. The one thing that kept from upgraded, was the difference in more affordable DSLR sensors, compared to the traditional 35mm format. I've always loved 50mm 1.8, untill it became more like a 70mm on the T2i. When I came across a youtube video shot with this lens, (30mm) I was sold. The colors are wonderful, the focusing is excellent for the price. The build is great, it's fast and looks nice on my camera. As far as focusing concerns go with this lens, I have no complaints. Try it out if your concerned before you purchase, but I'd recommend doing so soon, before the price goes up again. I bought mine in March at 438.00 flat, and the next week it went up $50.00. It's a great addition to any APS-C DSLR kit.

This is not and L lens, but it is pretty good for the money. I was looking for a prime lens for my crop sensor DSLR equivalent to a 50mm on a full frame camera, this Sigma lens was the perfect combination of price, quality and aperture (open wide at f1.4 you will get awesome bokeh). The main (huge)problem with this lens is, as many said before, its front focus issues. I had to go through 4 copies of this lens (from Amazon and B&H) before I got one that didn't have this problem. Some cameras can be adjusted to correct this issue, if you are willing to do this or to use only manual focus (most likely for video) you probably wouldn't mind if you get a bad copy. For people like me that use AF a lot and crave shallow DOF, then be very patient and get ready to send back some of these until you get a good copy.

Since small kids don't pose and move all the time, a fast lens is critical (image stabilization won't help if the subject moves). For cropped cameras (Rebels & x0Ds), I found 30mm is a good focal length for capturing the kids and their immediate environment as opposed to head/shoulder portraits for which one probably needs a 50mm or 85mm lens. The Sigma is very solidly constructed, is very sharp in the center (the corners are soft but the corners are invariably out-of-focus when shooting wide apertures anyway). I'm very pleased by the colors. Within the first week, I was capturing some of the best photos I've ever taken. Reviews from various sites strongly suggest that it has appreciably better image quality than the Canon 28mm f/1.8.

I bought the Sigma 30mm with my Canon Rebel xti and couldn't be happier for the purpose I bought it.  I've been using it for indoor baby photos but didn't want to use my flash and mainly use the available room light.  It works fantastic, bringing out deep rich colors in the room and opened all the way up to f1.4 provides very sharp portraits of our baby.  Its light weight and compact size are also pluses.  I have used it outdoors only occassionaly and have seen no issues except for some night shots where some light points show some abberations.  These dissappear depending on the angle you shoot to the light source.

I'm a canon brand snob. Never thought I would have had a good experience with this lens. I was looking for back and front focusing issues. But after a month of testing, This lens nails it. I also know how to look for operator error, focusing at that narrow DOF. A lot of fast lens get unfairly blamed. And it's usually due to the photog not understanding how to work at that shallow DOF. Its sharp and I shoot wide open 90% of the time. I love the contrast also. And the redesigned hard plastic looks way better than the previous coated finish. Overall the quality build is better than my canon 50mm 1.4. I'm happy :)

This really is now the sharpest lens I own. At around f/5, it's just stunning. It's great in low light situations as expected, and it's just a superb all around lens (I own 4 others, this is fast becoming my favorite).
5
Great Lens.  Works well in low light, no focus hesitation.  It's quick and quiet.  Gives me great control of depth of field, which was my primary concern. It's heavier than I expected, espcially when compaired to Olympus 4/3rds system lenses, but it's solid and well constructed. I recommend it as a standard lens for those looking for good depth of field control or who need to shoot in darker environments.

I'm usually very sketchy about buying 3rd party lenses, but this lens was an exception.  After using this lens under low light conditions, I have to admit that this lens is VERY sharp in the center while the corners tend to be soft.  I found some user opinions complaining about images not being sharp enough at wide open apertures. My other sharp primes (50mm f/1.8 and 85mm f/1.8) get softer and softer around the edges as the aperture is bigger and bigger. Same goes for this lens.  In normal light conditions, this lens is as sharp as some of my best prime lenses.  In low light conditions, I found image results to be sharp at f/1.8 and beyond.  Definitely a fast lens.  The autofocus is a little funny, but overall, I find it very difficult to take this prime lens off my D80. I highly recommend it!
5
The surface finish on this lens could be improved as it feels a bit like an over-oxidized gel coat surface, but this does not affect the lens's function.  The performance of this lens is spot on.  The autofocus is not quite as fast as Canon's 24-70L or 70-200Lis, but it is respectable (autofocus speed is similar Canon's 50mm f1.4).  The bokeh that this lens generates is fantastic and predictable.  There is little to no vignetting even with the lens wide open.  Shooting in a night club without a flash (ISO1600) is very possible, although the autofocus is a bit slower than in full daylight.  Overall and IMO, this is a must have lens for crop-sensor DSLR owners.  Holiday pictures will never have looked better.

Basically a 50mm f/1.4 prime lens when used on APS-C. That's about the ideal single-prime configuration.  Couldn't be happier! Camera body tested: Sony DSLR-A700 (APS-C) PRO: -Standard lens! 30mm has the same field-of-view as a 45mm lens on an APS-C sensor.  This is in "standard lens" territory, a solid approximation of a 50mm f/1.4 lens on a full-frame body. -focus is smooth and solid. -focus window (if you're into that kind of thing) -inexpensive -quick AF (due to the poor close-focus performance inherent to the design.  Everything's a tradeoff) -very sharp, even more so when stopped down to f/2.8 (2 stops) CON: -limited to APS-C bodies due to internal design decisions.  I prefer lenses that work equally well on full-frame and APS-C. (NOTE: consider the Sigma 28mm F1.8 EX DG Macro as an alternative, if you shoot both APS-C and full-frame) -magnification 1:10, oof.  That's pretty rough.  Don't expect to focus on close subjects. (near focus distance is 0.4m, 1.3ft) -Discontinued, replaced by the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 DC HSM A (more expensive) -Optically not as good as the Sigma 35mm f/1.4 DG HSM A (way more expensive), which is one of the best wide primes lenses available for the Sony A-mount, and is full-frame. When used on APS-C, I'd take this lens over my full-frame 50mm f/1.4.  The 50 is just too long, as it is equivalent to 75mm on APS-C, compared to 45mm for this one.  I like it.  I use it.  I'd recommend it to any APS-C shooter. If you shoot both full-frame and APS-C, consider the Sigma 28mm f/1.8 EX DG Macro.  it'll work about as well as this one on APS-C, but double as a fast wide prime on full-frame.  Only 2/3 stops slower aperture, but about 5x better Macro, no complaints there either.

In early September I received a brand new Sigma Canon version of the lens that front focused severely and would not focus properly on anything, near or far. I sent the lens -- with my Canon T3i camera -- to the Sigma New York facility that promised a 48-hour turnaround for adjustment.  Disappointment: $20 shipping charge. UPDATE 08-30-2012.  I received lens and camera back a few days ago from Sigma New York (they rec'd on a Wednesday, shipped out on Thursday -- promptly as promised.)  Lens now focuses properly using the viewfinder or live view.  I have taken photos indoors and out.  The lens focuses fast and will focus fast in very low light conditions -- amazing.  Colors are nice.  Bokeh, yes great!  Fits well and looks good on camera.  Compact size, medium weight.  Decent build quality and materials. **** Solid four-star product.  This lens simply allows you to get photos you cannot get with a slower lens!  Using live view and the rotating screen of the Canon T3i combined with the Sigma 30mm I get low light pictures at different angles and locations than otherwise possible (without flash). Bottom line.  Great lens (not a macro lens and maybe not the best landscape lens) with a possible aggravation factor -- the old story is true: be prepared to send (you pay shipping) to Sigma New York for adjustment (preferably with your camera).  Maybe most of the out-of-the-box Sigma 30's are okay but my situation was the same as that of many other reviewers. Update 12-7-2012.  Lens stays on my camera most of the time.  I am learning how to use both the camera and the lens.  Pleased with the performance.  Still amazed at the low light capabilities.  PSST:  fifty bucks off normal price now!

I really wanted to replace the plastic 50mm 1.8 with something a little faster with a wider focal length. I own a 50d and found that the 30mm focal length was just about perfect for taking indoor pictures of my 1 year old. I struggled for a long time over getting this lens or going for broke and getting the Canon 35mm 1.4. I've read tons of reviews, test charts, and compared direct images from both lenses. From what I found the two lenses are more similar than they are different and the only thing keeping me from getting the Sigma 30mm was all of the focusing issues I kept reading about. Finally I decided to get the lens, here are my thoughts about it below. Pros: - Very nice build quality - Fast, quiet focusing - Manual Focus override - $1000 cheaper than the Canon 35 1.4 - Sharp in the center at 1.4 and decent in the corners, super sharp from corner to corner by 2.8. - 1.4 at 30mm on a crop is so great. I can take pictures indoors without a flash. Cons: - All of the focusing comments about this lens are completely true. The copy I got of this lens front focused like crazy. I took around 1000 pics with it and about 50 were in focus. After dialing in +13 micro focus compensation on my 50d this lens focuses perfectly. - This is a very minor complaint but the manual focusing ring is pretty stiff. I've gotten used to it but it's much stiffer than the 70-200 f4 Canon I own. - Another minor complaint for the pixel peepers out there. This lens has quite a bit of purple fringing at 1.4 if you're looking at your pics at 100% detail. - Minimum focus distance is 15.7 inches, a little longer than the Canon 35 1.4 which focuses at 12 inches. Summary: I really like this lens but I wouldn't buy it unless I had a camera with the ability to micro adjust. If you've got a 50d or higher than it's probably a safe buy. Once I adjusted the focus on my camera I can honestly say that the pictures that come out of this lens are truly special. Even wide open at 1.4, the pictures of my son are sharp with great colors and contrast. If you own a camera that doesn't have micro focus capabilities than you better be a patient person that's willing to trade out 3 or 4 lenses to get one that focuses properly.

My gear: Canon Rebel T1i Tamron 28 - 75mm F/2.8 Sigma 10 - 20 Canon 50mm F/1.8 Kit lens which I do not use On the T1i the 1.6 crop factor makes the 50mm akin to the 85 in terms of 35mm equivalent.  I've shot many pictures with the 50mm and I was extremely pleased with the lens.  However it is just too tight to use in many situations.  On several occasions I found myself backing right out of the room to get the shot! Enter the 30mm Sigma.  The minute I put on the frame I loved it.  The lens feels sturdy.  Those who use the canon 50mm f/1.8 know what I'm talking about when I say that lens feels like a toy.  The Sigma feels like a good chunk of glass should. The field of view is about the same as the 50mm on a standard full-frame SLR (or DSLR).  It feels natural to use the lens - what you see what you capture. Focus.  The focus is tack sharp - on par with the Canon 50mm F/1.8 (aka "the Nifty Fifty").  I have no focus issues at all - the autofocus gets it better than I can do manually even if I do live display and 10x zoom.  It is soft at 1.4, softer than the 50mm at 1.8.  But, by the time I step it to 1.8 it is very sharp - and I have 1.6 and 1.4 available in super low-light or to really tighten the DOF.  (note that I've only used  f/1.4 in very low light so far.)  The AF does hunt in low light - but I can't fault the lens for this since it happens with all my lenses on the T1i frame. As a prime lens is sharper and produces better IQ than my 28 - 75 Tamron, even though I have to overlap with this lens. This is my new "default" lens.  Back in the day the SLRs used to ship with a 50mm lens and now having this 30mm on my 1.6 crop sensor feels just right. I've had no focus issues with the lens - it focuses right on about 98% of the time which is the same with all my lenses, including the Canon ones. In summary, if you're looking for a good prime lens I would recommend the Sigma 30mm.  In my experience the lens is just great.

I give this 5 stars. Why? Not because it's the perfect lens, but because it's perfect for what I wanted. I think people who demand every lens to be perfect in every aspect are going to be severely disappointed every time. Okay so what did I look for when buying this lens? I shot with an XTi for about 6 months and then upgraded to a 40D and in that time I used various zoom lenses; the only prime (fixed focal length) lens I owned was the 50mm f1.8 II. I take a lot of photographs of indoor events so I needed a fast lens and since my zoom lens only went to f4, I ended up using my 50mm prime a lot. The problem with that was that it was too long (80mm equivalent) to get a lot of people in the pictures in a closed setting, so I wanted something wider (preferably something that would get me close to 50mm INCLUDING the 1.6x crop factor). That made me look at this lens and the Canon 28mm f1.8. They cost about the same, but the Sigma is a bit faster while the 28mm has slightly better overall performance. After a while I chose to get this lens because I really wanted the f1.4. And this Sigma 30mm would give me an equivalent of 48mm on a full frame, so this was about as close to 50mm as I could get. I'd read a lot about how this lens can have trouble with back-focusing and whatnot but so far I've had no trouble with it on my 40D. The build is really good but it does seem a little heavy after getting used to my cheapo, light 50mm. In terms of picture quality, in all real world uses, the images are wonderful. This lens is known for being a little soft on the borders and being WAY soft on the extreme borders but usually in pictures these parts are insignificant anyways. [...] There's an example of a photo taken with f1.4. The middle is quite sharp and who cares about the borders, right? That's going to be out of focus anyway. The focusing is accurate for me and the HSM for sigma is really quiet and fast so it's nice. I've had this lens for a couple days now and I've probably taken over a 100 shots already, and I have to say I'm really really happy with it. If you're a big-shot photographer, you probably don't even need this lens 'cause you probably have a full-frame camera which can use any of the three awesome 50mm lenses that Canon has, but honestly if you're an amateur to advanced amateur, I think you'll be plenty satisfied with just the strengths of this lens (which by the way, is the center sharpness. It's ridiculously sharp) :]

After resisting buying this lens for a long time, I finally caved in after the canon 50mm f/1.8 or 1.4 was too limiting on my rebel XT. I haven't regretted the purchase. It is a tad soft at f/1.4, but not unbearable as long as you don't pixel peep (the 50mm f/1.4 was definitely sharper). My first copy was sharp with no front focusing issues. So I cannot attest to the quality issues of Sigma. I use this lens exclusively in the 1.4-2.0 range as I have the excellent Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 for breathtaking shots f/2.8 and above. I only use the center focusing point on my Rebel XT and it hasn't given me any focus problems, though it is difficult to confirm the focusing using rebel xt's small viewfinder. With a thin DOF there is plenty of margin for errors, but I have managed to focus accurately most of the time. After an initial auto focus, I use the manual focus to check my focus. The only thing ugly about the images it produces is the bokeh. It produces a wierd rounded triangular bokeh, as though one side of a circle was smashed in. Never seen anything like that before. But the quality of the images is otherwise very good and well saturated and I am willing to live with the bokeh. Others may not be so forgiving. The build quality is nothing big to brag about. It has a black matte finish which seems delicate and susceptible easily to scratches or dust sticking to it. Otherwise, it feels solid and as heavy as canon L primes. With the cost of this lens, and the Tamron 17-50mm lens, I have essentially committed myself to crop cameras. It has been my experience that, for the sub 500$ lenses, crop lenses often more useful, have much better color and sharpness than any full frame lens in the same price range with some notable exceptions like the canon 50mm f/1.4 & f/1.8.

I really like this lens. I own a d60. It's fast, sharp, and i think fits/balances well with the d60 body. I don't have the front focus problems that so many mention. From what i gather, it seems that all the front focus problems are noticed with the D200 and D300. not sure if that is because of something to do with the sensors of those cameras or what. I'm no professional so take that with a grain of salt. Or maybe us d40 and d60 owners are not as exact in our skills as the d200 and d300 owners and i just don't recognized the flaws of this lens. Anyway, i've take about a thousand photos on walkabouts so far and the colors look great, the images sharp. This lens has not been off the camera at all since then. Good luck! Follow up review. I've had this lens for almost 10 months or so. I love it. It's on my camera about 50% of the time. It splits time with my 85mm 1.4 and my sigma 10-20.  My friend has new nikon 35mm 1.8. The build quality is so much better with the sigma. Granted it's twice as much, but you can feel why. This lens makes the nikon feel like a kit lens. As far as image quality goes, there really is not too much difference that i can notice though, so based on image alone, i'd say just go with the nikon since the images are about the same, plus the nikon is more compact and has less minimal focusing distance. I'm keeping my sigma though, have no plans on ever selling it or even traiding it for the nikon plus cash.

I was a little nervous about getting this lens cause I read a few reviews saying quite a few had forward focus issues. But I have a Nikon D300 with auto-focus fine tuning so I bought it. I tested it right away with a focus chart and it was 100% spot on. Mine is also very fast to focus and usually nails the focus first time. There were a few times, even in good lighting that I had to release the shutter and try again, but about the same as my other lenses except my Nikor 18-200mm, man that thing alway nails the focus on first shot. Anyway, colors look true to life and well balanced. Only slight barrel distortion, pretty much undetectable in most pics. I gave it a rating of 4 cause there are sharper lenses available. But for this price range and these specs I'd say that it competes well. It feels solid and has a sexy finish (yes I think some lenses look sexy). My Nikor 50mm f/1.4 is a lot smaller and cheesier looking. This lens has a full body feel to it. I have had a larger than normal share of blown highlights, But I expected that from reading other reviews. In P mode I usually just stay 2/3 stops under to avoid this. Uhmm, guess that about covers everything. I have high expectations of lenses if that helps. I like to see a clean image with crisp lines even when zoomed in at 100% (shooting RAW) I would buy it again if I broke or lost this one.

I've had this lens now for about 6 months.  I don't use it all the time, but do use it frequently.  On a recent vacation to Disney World I had accident with my walk-around zoom lens.  Luckily I had this lens with me too and it performed like a champ.  Overall on that trip I took about 1000 images with it. I like the focal range on the digital format. It gives a very similar view to what the human eye see's. For film the 50mm gave this, however the 50mm now becomes a longer field of view and that can make for some tight shooting. Biggest issue I've come across is getting greater noise wide open at high ISO's. At times, on vacation, I didn't have the opportunity to stop and set up a tripod and take a long exposure. So I had to shoot wide open at ISO 1600 (on my Nikon D50). More often than not I was able to get fast enough shutter speeds to get the images I wanted handheld. Obviously depth of field at the f/1.4 is VERY shallow. So you have to be comfortable enough with your camera to get spot on focus points.  Stopped down to f/2.8-f/11, I've found this lens VERY good.  I've gotten a lot of sharp images. This is a great lens for everyday candids in low light situation with or without a flash.

I am very happy with this lens, not RAVING MAD happy, but satisfyingly pleased.  I'm going to try to make this review as balanced and objective as possible. I've been using the lens for about a month now, at home and on vacation (so it's been quite a lot of pictures woohoo).  I've used it in many situations, some of which you might say the lens is not made for, but I'm just trying to give an all-around review in as many scenarios as possible.  Here's how the lens, in my opinion, plays out. THE GOOD: - Excellent general purpose lens. - 30mm focal length creates a wide enough angle for most situations. - Images are pretty contrasty and pleasing. - Reasonably sharp in good and even mediocre light.  And for the casual photographer (like myself), it's more than sharp enough, especially considering the breadth of its applications. - The 1.4 maximum aperture is GREAT for low light situations and can also be used to blur out the backgrounds of photos to accentuate the subject (however, see portraits in "The Bad") - The HSM focusing mechanism works well with my camera and is reasonably fast.  (Faster than my 18-55mm, but noticeably slower than my other Nikon primes) - The focus ring is just stiff enough.  You'll be holding it often, so the stiffness helps keep you from manually focusing when you don't need to. - In my opinion the lens looks pretty stylin' on the camera haha. THE BAD: - I would not advise using this lens for portraits if you are serious about it.  The angle of view requires you to move close to your subject and sadly stretches out his/her face.  For portraits, please use the 50mm or longer.  (however, if you're shooting 3 people at a dinner table, it's totally fine) - Can't focus very close, making macro work difficult. - No Auto/Manual focus switch on the lens (must be switched in the camera. - Sometimes (and this is in practice) the lens fails to focus well in low light situations, make sure the lens cap is off. - The rear lens cap is terrible, throw it away and buy a Nikon one. OVERALL: This lens can be summed up in two words: GENERAL PURPOSE, don't forget that, GENERAL PURPOSE.  Don't expect super stellar pictures, but I'd say this lens is indispensable for traveling and general photography.  It's awesome performance in low light is especially great for people who hate the destructive effects of the on-camera flash.  Hope this helps :)

(Sigma 30mm 1.4 with Canon 60D) I read lots of great reviews mixed with lots of not so great reviews for this lens.  But for the price, I had to take the chance.  (I bought this used here in mint condition from an Amazon seller.)  Yes, it's true that the picture quality is somewhat "soft" and "fuzzy" wide open at 1.4. That was very obvious. BUT...like many of us have learned, it's much sharper closed down a bit from the largest aperture. I've taken some nice sharp shots at f/2, believe it or not. Another common complaint was focus accuracy.  Luckily, I haven't had that problem. I tested the lens for that as soon as I got it. I was hoping I didn't have to go through BUY, SELL, BUY, SELL, BUY before I found a good one. I got lucky.  The focus accuracy has been absolutely fine.  No issues in that regard. To be honest, I haven't really spent enough time with this Sigma 30mm 1.4 to give a more comprehensive review, but I will say that it's SOLIDLY BUILT and the glass is very impressive.  I'm very happy with this lens thus far.

I love this lens! I use it all the time for low light situations like band/concert photography, or even in my living room. I also have the 50mm 1.8 from Nikon and that is a great lens for the price (beautiful bokeh) but sometimes in a small living room or area, it's hard to get a shot without having to back halfway out of the room. On Nikon DSLRs the 50mm is actually more like 75mm - which is great for a portrait lens, but not great if you want to photograph a large family in a living room. This lens is great for that and so much more. I've also used it for portraiture and was very happy with it. With the crop factor this lens is actually 45mm and closer to what the Nifty Fifty would have been on a film slr. Mine has no focusing issues and has accurate color representation. I put off buying one for months because of all the negative posts I read. All I can say is, get one and try it out for yourself. My copy was fine and I'm having a lot of fun with it. This lens combined with the Nikon D90 is killer for taking low light photos!

I have had this lens for a while and decided to finally make a review. I have to say the build quality of it is amazing. As soon as you take it out of the box you feel that it has a sort of flat black fuzz on the plastic that keeps it from ever looking greasy from hand oils. Also unlike Canon lenses Sigmas come with a glare guard and a small canvas zipper case. I don't use the case granted but if you ever sell the lens it is nice to have. Anyway have a lens with this wide of an aperture is indispensable. Once you get anything below a 3.5 you don't go back. I had this lens, my kit 18-55mm f3.5 and the canon 75-300mm f4-5.6. I can say that I used this lens almost 80% of the time that I shot. Also you fall in love with prime lenses because of the sharpness you can get for the money. Long story short if your like me and you were considering the Canon "nifty fifty" or 50mm 1.8 but have extra cash to spend on a lens, get this one instead you will be very happy you did. I swear by Sigma and have had no problems with this lens.

I purchased this lens as a good low light and portrait lens.  Unfortunately, after thorough testing the sharpness was not up to par.  At first, I thought it was me, so I took a few sample shots. My first sample shot was a close distance (5 ft) handheld.  I had a low light shot using f/1.4 and 1/100 and my focus points were a little shaky.  Most likely my fault since it was hand held. My second sample shot, I got a tripod and stopped it down to f/2.8.  Again, the focus point was fuzzy.  Again, I was a little skeptical because maybe it was me pressing the shutter. My third sample shot, I set it on a timer (2 seconds)... again, the shot was a little fuzzy. Distraught, I went to take an outside shot so I could gauge it better in better lit areas and better focus.  This didn't work either. I really think that I may have just gotten a bad copy, so I'm returning this lens.  This would have been good for an upcoming wedding (my cousins), but I'll stick with a Canon 50mm 1.4, though I'd have liked a wider angle.

Bought this lens last week at amazon for (IMO) an amazing price of $289. It's a great lens for cropped bodies (like my T2i) and an amazing value for the build quality and f1.4 with HSM. The first thing I did was to test for front focusing issues that has been the biggest complaint so far about this lens and am very happy to learn that the copy I got didn't have any of those issues. The lens itself is considerably heavier than the 50mm 1.8 canon lens I have (which must be the lightest and cheapest build wise) and the autofocus was noticeably faster and quieter, but not as quiet as other canon HSM lens (L included) that I tried. The picture quality is amazing and is quite a bit sharper than canon 50mm 1.8 even at 1.4f and I am comparing the canon's 2.0f and higher. Came with the petal shaped lens hood and a zippered carrying case and some leaflets of printed material.

Before starting the evaluation of this lens it's important to understand that this is the only auto-focus lens that is near "normal" on cropped DSLRs with max aperture below 1.8 and costing less than $1000. It is also substantially smaller than other lenses with such a focal range and aperture. It is therefore not surprising that this lens will come with a number of compromises and therefore will not be to everyone's liking. The good thing about this lens that it is indeed F1.4 lens. It's quite sharp in the center right from F1.4. Stopped to 2.0 the center is excellent and most of the frame is good.  At F5.6 even the far corners are good (but not excellent). In most situations the bokeh is pleasing making the lens suitable for portraits and subject isolation in general. Besides the corner sharpness the main optical flaw of the lens is high chromatic aberrations, or colored fringes on contrasty edges. Most fast lenses (including for example Canon 50mm F1.4) have this problem (although often to a lesser degree) so I cannot blame Sigma too much. In addition the problem can be partly fixed in software. The AF is fast the lens is quite compact and well built. Another nice plus is 3 year warranty. Overall I'd happily give this lens 5 STARS if not for Sigma quality control. The first lens I've got was back-focusing. I've got it replaced by the seller. The second lens was misfocusing randomly in about 25% of the shots. I've sent it for calibration to Sigma and it returned both misfocusing and backfocusing. I've sent it again for calibration together with my camera, only to get it back to the original state ... still misfocusing randomly in about 25% of the shots. I've sent it once again to a different Sigma repair center, but the lens again was not fixed. At that time I've figured out the problem with my lens. It misfocused when focusing from a more distant to a closer point. I've called Sigma and managed to convince them to give me a replacement. At long last (6 months later) I have a lens that focuses accurately. On the positive side of things the customer service was nice and it paid for all shipping of the lens to the center and back (except the first one).

I returned the copy of this lens I ordered through Amazon...bad copy I suppose -- it simply wouldn't focus (auto or manual) on anything beyond 6 or 8 feet.  Since I'd heard other complaints of bad copies of the lens I didn't mail order a second time and waited until I found a store (Canoga Camera near L.A) where I could test a couple copies.  First copy I tried at the store worked fine.  Once you get a decent copy I think you'll like (perhaps not love) this lens. It is soft wide open, though the softness isn't as bad as you first think -- it's just hard to get good focus with the thin DOF at 1.4.  Softness hasn't bothered me much; I find that the softness combines nicely with the color noise at high ISO to produce reasonable images in very low light.  I've taken some good shots by the light of a camp fire and by the light of the television.  Autofocus is useless in very low light, but MF works fine, resulting in somewhat soft images with nice rich colors. Color is another somewhat quirky thing with this lens.  It sometimes (especially in incandescent light) produces warm, amazingly saturated colors, though this is hit or miss.  I think the lens is worthwhile just for the ocassional times it does produce really *amazing* indoor available light photos.  (And even when it misses and fails to amaze, you often get reasonable results.) Sharpness is good stopped down to F4 or so.  I purchased this primarily for indoor photos of my kids, but it's also great outdoors when in can be stopped down.  On a 1.6 crop 30D it's a nice length for walk around.  But indoors is where the 30mm is exactly what I need -- wider than my 50mm, just as fast.  Though not as sharp as the 50mm, the shorter focal length allows slower shutter speed hand held shots (of stationary subjects) in even less light. If you're thinking of this lens you're probably interested in very low light (or you might go with the Canon 28mm/1.8 instead).  This lens will allow you to take low light images you couldn't get any other way (without paying Canon L prices for the 24 or 35 F1.4 lenses).  If you the patience/skill to use manual focus (or don't mind disturbing subjects with an AF assist lamp) this lens produces some excellent low light images.

I really wanted to like this lens.  It has good build quality, is fast, comes with a lens hood and case, has a 4 year warranty, has HSM which I believe is similar to Canon's USM and makes for quiet, fast focusing, and is a great focal length (equivalent to 50 mm) for my Canon 30D.  I was planning to use it for indoor shots without a flash.  HOWEVER, it really does have problems getting the subject in focus.  This does not seem to be just a function of the narrow depth-of field.  The Canon 50 mm 1.4 (A GREAT lens, by the way) doesn't have this problem at f/1.4.  I'm going to try the Canon 28 mm f/1.8.

Brief and simple, super quiet focus. Amazing pictures, colors are brilliant even at low light. Close up images at 1.4 are super razor sharp. Recommended, extremely happy that I bought it. A lens that will make a normal light look amazing. Took a trip to NASA Kennedy Space Center where there is all the tech shinny metal surfaces, glass, electronics and this lens was just incredible how it captured light, glassy surfaces, crisp edges etc. Its a little tricky as this lens is very precise when focusing, sometimes you have to play a little with the White Balance and under-over expose to bring up the shine or get more shadows etc. I prefer to use my D60 with D-Lightning and Noise Reduction off, but thats just me with this lens. Focusing is super fast quiet. Highly recommended!

I had been using a Nikon 50mm 1.8 but was running into issues using it indoors. Even the very large room I do shoots in I was having to move too far back to get everything in frame. Using this lens (even on a crop sensor) I have had no such issue. I can get much closer while keeping everything in frame. At 1.4 it is super fast, the pictures I have taken so far are as crisp and sharp as I would expect from even much higher priced lenses. The auto focus is also very quick. I have had no back or front focusing issues I had seen a few others mention. That was the first thing I tested and was very impressed with how well it performed. I would definitely recommend this to any of the people reading this that like I, were on the fence about ordering one. You will not be disappointed.

I read all the reviews about bad focus and softness, and also all the high ratings, and decided to go for it anyway. The lens focuses fine on both my 20 and 40d. It's real fast wide open, even a big difference over the 50mm f1.8. Color and contrast are nice, I don't really see any light fall off on the edges from a practical standpoint. It is a wee bit soft wide open, but I can't imagine someone getting a lens like this who doesn't post process; a little sharpening and it's dead on. The focus motor is quick and quiet. The lens is solid and firm in all respects, comes with a hood and a decent case. I think the focal length is nice on a crop cam, the 50mm is too close in most cases indoors. The blur is pleasing (bokeh). Go for it, you won't be unsatisfied.

May 31, 2013 Update:  I've been using for about a year now.  The quality of the pictures with this lens is easy to notice, specially for larger prints (11x14 and up).  Printed a couple in glicee and it looks very moody and creamy colors.  For my use, I wish it was wider, since I use an APS-C sensor.  I have just to step back.  If anyone has a chance to go to Bouchard Gardens in British Columbia with this lens, it will be a rewarding experience.  I did.  It is still rewarding. Wow:  The picture quality.  Took close up of nursery flowers under overcast skies.  Printed using professional service and using 'metalic' finish a few 8 x 10 and 11 x 14s.  WOW!  Yes, it's fixed focus, but the quality is awesome.  Great for portraits.

I used this lens on my Canon 7D. It takes extremely sharp photos, and is able to focus very quickly. I have had to do minimal lens correction in Lightroom, and only for perspective, not for color aberration. I think it's a very nice lens at a very nice price. I later purchased the Canon 5d Mark iii and this lens still worked on that body, even though Amazon says it will not. There was some very minor vignetting. Regardless, I sold the lens to purchase a zoom lens. But it was really good, and I definitely recommend it for crop bodies.

Wanted a lens for low light no flash situations.Went to northern Europe and took 1250 pics with this lens & Nikon d40. All the museums and cathedrals are NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY. Only had 4 out of focus,the rest were clear vivid & sharp as a tack.  Did not experience any of the front or rear focus issues that were posted. The f 1.4 did its work and work it did. No problem autofocusing in low light. So if you have a d40 d40x or d60 this is the lens.Build quality is excellent.Makes a great package with the d40.

I had this lens for 2 years. During that time it was my everyday lens. The 30mm is perfect all around lens for a crop sensor. The build quality is nice and the quietness makes it sounds faster than it already is. The Bokeh is smooth. I sold my camera gear because of school, and once I started photographing again I immediately started looking for this one and it's 50mm brother. Here are a couple of examples [...] [...] [...] [...]

The lens really produce a great image especially in low light.  The quality of the picture is very high and the price is very cheap with this level of aperture (f/1.4).  The 30mm is the best distance to take person or small group pictures during dinner when the light is very dim (which we do most of the time).  However, the auto focus is not working well especially in a very white background or close distance.  So if you do manual focus, it will be the best lens for u for low light!

Contemplated this lens for my Canon T1i for some time. Got hooked shooting in low light with a Canon 50mm 1.8 and knew I wanted something with a little wider field of view.  Worked this lens for about 3 weeks and love it.  I read about all the front focus issues and set up a tapemeasure at an angle for some testing. Everything is right-on without any issues. It will provide a narrow DOF so make sure you got your focus point set right. It has become my main walkaround lens.
5
Sure, it's not perfect for pixel peepers, but for the purpose Sigma markets this (it's aimed at folks wanting a fast, widish APS-C prime for indoor kids' parties and soforth) it does a great job. Not as sharp as the Sony 35 1.8, but the extra 2/3 stop is nice to have. And you can use the MF/AF toggle on the camera to swap focus modes, which you can't do with Sony's own low-cost equivalent. Recommended.

The picture quality is amazing, very vibrant and crystal clear. Going to 1.4 is a huge plus for video in low light... however, only buy this if you plan to buy a new one every 3 months. Since for video we can't rely on autofocus and have to manually, constantly, be sliding the focus ring around, it breaks. The focus ring now slips constantly as I try to pul focus, which means if you're shooting something important like a wedding where you only have ONE chance to get the shot, this poorly made focus ring can kill your shot if it decides to slip on you. Buyer beware.
5
Far exceeded all of my expectations.  And my expectations are very high. I still can not believe the amount of detail and the contrast this lens delivers.  I have 1.8 20mm Sigma lens, which I thought was pretty good, as long as I applied some sharpening in post-processing. But this thing blows it out of the water completely.

well the last 4 weeks have been nothing short of a roller-coaster ride with this lens. The first sample that turned up on Amazon was good and gave me some great pictures until I started the dreaded pixel peeping with this lens. AF was considerably as fast as a Canon but was front focussing - test with focus charts too proved the same. Some sleepless nights since the lens had never come off my Canon t3i since I put the two together - the pictures were keepers (atleast most of them) but I could not live with a new lens with front focus issues. I called up Sigma NY and they were willing to fix the problem in 1-2 working days (minus shipping time back and forth) but I could not afford to send my only camera body across for more than a week. Amazon to the rescue - a call to customer service - bang without asking a question they send a replacement that reaches me in 1 day. I used both the lenses together but the one that was sent later seemed to be of the newer lot (serial number, construction - matter finish). Gingerly as I put on the lens and prayed and clicked some pictures and went testing again with focus charts. AF was spot on - and they alternately using both the lenses for a couple of days before shipping the "defective" lens back to Amazon, I came to the following conclusions: Pros: 1. This lens has an Amazing DOF - very narrow. At 1.4 this should be the case anyway. Don't know why one reviewer put it as a negative trait. 2. If you can focus properly (tripod helps at f1.4) - the center sharpness is amazing. 3. Construction is solid - much better than Canon 50mm f1.4 coupled with 4 year Sigma warranty 4. HSM pretty fast  - as good as Canon AF 5. F1.4 means its great for low light conditions and pictures are pretty usable with some sharpening in PS come out great. 6. VFM not cheap - till Canon has a 28/30 f1.4 - effective 50mm on APS-C sensors at a competing price - this is always going to be a better choice. 7. Lastly great PQ - good contrast and great bokeh. Period. Cons: 1. Poor QC for lenses/maybe the reason put out by Sigma does hold true wrt variation of AF on DSLR bodies not being standardized. Anyway their customer service folks have heard of this problem and have a fix for it. Only if there was a better solution than shipping the lens with body to Sigma. 2. Can be difficult at f1.4 since DOF is narrow. This is both a pro and con - depends on the end user 3. Cant find any for the last two mins - Sigma could have included a coupon for ice cream along with the lens. The packing and box was good. (its not a con). Pretty much to sum it up - its a good lens - great IQ and good contrast coupled with a VFM label means its always going to be a good seller. Can fall into the great category if Sigma can do something to address the focus issues. Overall a great buy for crop sensor cameras' provided you get a good copy/get is calibrated.

I ordered this lens and when I received it the exterior shipping box had been severely damaged during shipping (busted open and ripped down the side then re taped poorly) This first copy of the lens I received was a BIG disappointment. I"m not sure if it was a defective lens or damaged during shipping. It had severe focusing issues. At close range it would be off several inches at a distance of 10 ft it was off by 3 ft. Very inconstant and very soft even where the actual focus hit.  I contacted amazon via the refund/replacement section online and they replaced my lens via an overnight shipment so I received a new copy the very next day.  It was a night and day difference! I love the 30mm focal length as a normal length lens on my Canon T2i. It is relatively sharp wide open very comparable to other mid-range/cost lenses.  It's no L series lens but I would say it is comparable in build quality and image sharpness/contrast to my Canon 50 1.4. As stated this lens is relatively sharp wide open (a touch of sharpening in PS is perfect - which I do on most of my photos anyway) - This lens gets sharp fast when stopped down slightly to just f/1.8 - f/2 - f/2.2. The build quality is very nice and solid. It's heavier and slightly larger than my Canon 50 1.4.  I haven't tested/used any other wide angle primes. My other option was Canon's 28 1.8 at around $100 more or Canon's 35 f/2 at around $100 less (but without USM) or the 28mm 2.8 for $200 less (without USM and slower than what I wanted).  So after lots of debate and research I chose to try the Sigma 30 1.4.  With my second copy of this lens I am satisfied overall. However, I would love to personally compare this lens to Canon's 28mm 1.8.  This lens is my first 3rd party/non-canon lens, so I was skeptical at first and disappointed with my first copy. So, give it a shot. Order from amazon, so if you have problems returns/exchanges are No Problem!

I had the Nifty-Fifty (Canon 50mm f1.8 II) for last two years and absolutely loved it for its low light capability. There were however occasions when i wished it was wider eg. shooting a wedding reception (not professionally). My original plan for upgrade was to get the 50mm f/1.4 and live with 50mm focal length but then i did some research and came across this Sigma 30mm f1.4. On paper it seemed PERFECT for me. Faster than 1.8 and wider than 50mm; actually pretty close to "real" 50mm on my crop-sensor Canon. I considered the Canon 28mm f1.4 also but thought it might be a bit too wide for me and also i didn't care if i could use it on a full sensor or not - with cameras like 7d around; i don't think i will splurge for a full-frame. This lens met all my expectations but it does gets couple of shots overexposed. My solution is to shoot in RAW+JPEG that way i get to fix the occasional overexposed shots with no issue. It looks very nice on my T1i and captures unbelievale shots even in extremely low light. If Canon 28mm 1.4 does not have this overexposure issue; that might be a better option but i can't pass the judegement as i have not used it. Even at 30mm when shooting portraits of kids, i find it a bit wider than desired having been using a 50mm for 2 years for same but i can always crop its output; reverse is not possible :) If you are just starting with Fast Primes (or with DSLRs), I would recommend getting the Canon f1.8 50mm to experiment with and to learn the "tricks of the trade". If you are concerned with its 50mm focal length; don't be - i lived with it for 2 years and never took it off of my camera. Yes you will have to back way off to take a group shot but its do-able. Also if you happen to have the 18-24mm kit lens, that would cover your wide-angle shots just good enough though you will need to use the flash in low light with it. That lens will get you amazing portraits and costs 1/4th of this step-up lens. 08/24/11 UPDATE: I read a review that also mention this overexposure issue and concluded that this lens is actually faster than the advertised 1.4 aperture! Looking at that, its really amazing but you do need to compensate for overexposure either at the time taking the shot (not ideal) or shoot RAW and adjust afterwards which is much better as there are times when it does NOT overexposes. 05/04/12 UPDATE: I finally experienced the front-focus issue with this lens. My subject was about 12 feet away and even though i used center-point focus lock, it still did not focus on the subject. I did more tests and find out it can focus accurately at closer distances but for larger distance, there is an issue. I am a bit disappointed at that and decided to switch to a Canon lens. I had 28mm 1.8 in mind but reading many reviews about its issues, i settled for the old and trusty 35mm f2 and am loving it! I wish Canon would update this old lens (will love to get USM on it) but as for performance, its superb.

Summary: To keep it short, this is a great lens. Very versatile when shooting indoor events in small areas, like a makeup session or guests tables in weddings. You have 30mm, which is wider than the regular 50mm primes we all have in our camera bags, and you have a 1.4 aperture which allows you to shoot in really dark areas without getting your ISO above 800. Sharpness: It's not sharp wide open, but usable. It's definitely sharper wide open than the Canon 50mm/1.4 so if you are familiar with the Canon you'll have an idea about this one. I usually shoot at f/2 or f/2.2 @ ISO 800 or 1600, I only take it to f/1.4 when I find myself forced to go higher in ISO. I use it outdoor in good light also and as any other prime out there, at small apertures like f/4 or higher it's super sharp. Auto Focus: Very nice, it actually finds focus in areas where I cant see anything to manual focus in. It's also very good help when you are not doing a professional job and just hanging out with friends, that any friend can focus with it even in dark indoor clubs. Full time MF is a nice plus although I never use it, it's either AF or MF to me. HSM is silent and fast. Build Quality: Very very well built, better than Canon's EF-S lenses, and better than the Canon non-L primes, the 50 or 85. The included hood is very good addition, and the lens cap being center pinch type it's also very helpful to use with the hood. I hit it a 100 times when doing street photography at night and it never had a scratch. Image parameters (other than sharpness): This lens has a weird thing, that I actually love really, it over exposes a bit. If you take any lens, say the 18-55 kit of Canon, and shoot at 30mm f/4 and use this Sigma at 30mm f/4, and all other settings are the same, you'll find the Sigma's photo to be a bit more brighter than the Canon, dont know why really. Also the Colors of this lens is a bit warmer than usual which is great for what I use it for. Indoor events, weddings, etc usually are "warm" events so warmer is good. I shoot RAW all the time though so this doesn't affect me much, I added this for the JPG shooters. Equipment I use (as a reference) is: Canon 450D, Canon 350D, Canon 70-200 F4L IS, Sigma EX 10-20 F4-5.6, Canon 50mm F/1.4, Canon 85mm F/1.8, Canon 10-22 F/3.5-4.5 All in all, it's a great lens, perfect for indoor events when you need a wider view than conventional primes, not very good for closeup portraits coz you wont be able to fill a face in the frame and keep a good DOF to show it, you'd better use a 50 or even an 85 for this particular application. A 5 star recommendation.

I originally purchased this lens back in January, but that lens had both front and back focus issues as well as general inconsistencies with focusing. Also, the auto focus motor was about half the speed of the lens I had rented. The front and back focus issues were not really noticeable when photographing 3D objects (though its inconsistent nature was noticeable), but text and other 2D objects allowed you to notice the focusing issues. It is a great lens in low light especially combined with the great low light ability with my D90. The focal length equivalent of 45mm on a 35mm camera works way better for me than the Nikon 50mm f1.8. If you are looking to do indoor photography in low light, this is your lens. In addition, the weight and size work great with the D90, but it is a little big on the D40 since it extends a few millimeters below the bottom of the camera. I had considered the Nikon 35mm f2, but in the end I preferred the extra stop for low light. I also like how the Sigma does not protrude beyond the frame of the lens when focusing unlike the Nikon primes. The focusing ring does not move when autofocusing and you have manual override as well. As for sharpness the Nikon seemed sharper to me at the same stop, but not by a large degree. Thanks to Amazon's great return policy they replaced the lens within 2 days of my replacement request and without any additional cost to me. The new lens works way better. Front and back focus issues are almost non-existent, and focus consistency is far better. Also, the focus motor is significantly faster, though as a side effect it is also a little louder. However, it is still quieter than my Nikon 50mm f1.8 and the Nikon 35mm f2 that I rented. I have been disappointed with Sigma's well documented quality control. But as long as you purchase them from a company with a great return policy like Amazon then you should have no worries. Also, I heard that Sigma is pretty good about servicing their lenses.

(I don't know why Amazon mixes together Nikon and Canon reviews, but whatever... Here we go!) I purchased the Canon version of this lens and the first thing I did was set it to autofocus and train it on my cat... who's black. Lens picked up the focus in about 1/15th of a second under low-light conditions. That said... I have NO idea why you would pay 500 bucks for a lens and set it to auto-focus. There are millions of dirt cheap automatic point and shoot cameras in the world... why not go for one of them? But for those who are serious about photography or video this lens is a dream... and there's absolutely no canon equivalent. Build quality is amazing. Comes with a lens hood. Really tight focus ring that will take you millimeter by millimeter. Excellent color representation. Now if you're doing VIDEO... prepare to be impressed. You'll be able to film your own "Big Fish" or "Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus." Absolutely stunning quality when used for video. EXCELLENT low-light capabilities. You can use your camera's digital zoom to help with focusing (you know... *cough* *cough*... MANUAL focusing). I've shot photos and video in dark, dark clubs and I can tell you that this lens will get you there. If you know anything about lenses then you know about the Diffraction Aperture Limit (if you don't google it). I haven't had time to figure out what the sharpest F-stop on this camera is yet. 1.4 is obviously not going to be very sharp. 5.6 is diamond sharp. I'll add to my review once I get some lights and I can really dig into what the lens can do. But you're talking $1000 and Carl Zeiss before you find a better lens than this. ...for Canon at least.

I received the lens this morning and I was exhilarated to open the box.  I took out the lens, and it was heavy and had a firm grip to it which I quickly came to appreciate.  Because of all the words online about focusing issues, I went ahead and printed out a focus test chart to test it for myself.  On a side note, I'm an assistant photographer for for a professional and have tested other lenses as well.  Luckily the lens did not have back focus or front focus issues tested on a Canon 30D body.  However, I had numerous shots on real subjects in which the focus was off the intended subjects.  I noticed that this problem was a result of partly on the camera part: 30D seemed to have a little bit of trouble detecting contrasts under low light with this lens (I am reluctant to attribute this focusing issue entirely on my 30D since it doesn't have the same problem when paired with a Canon 100mm 2.8 macro lens).  I then tried focusing on the same subjects under the same setting with a 5D and did not experience the same focus problem.  Regarding sharpness of the lens, this is not as sharp as my Canon 100mm macro and has a pretty far minimum focusing distance.  That is probably because I'm so used to shooting with 100mm macro all the time that I wanted this Sigma to focus a bit closer.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the lens for its excellent performance under low light and its color rendition; I will be very much delighted to test it again on a photoshoot.  Lastly, I want to mention that there is a bit of purple fringing in highlights when aperture is wide open at 1.4, a fact that I was aware of by reading online professional reviews prior to purchase.  As of this moment I would give it a 4 star.

the edges are indeed soft (even if focus is on the edges prior to recomposing). however, as an amateur photographer, I am happy with the quality of this lens, especially in indoor pictures when I photograph children. I think this lens will stay on my pentax kx as the default lens

on second copy.  First one actually focused very well, but was slightly asymterically soft on the right side.  Returned it and bought a used one which was clibrated by sigma.  Very sharp.  However, it does misfouces about  20% of the time on the xt, when the object is about 15 feet away, and has poor contrast or back lit, or light is low.  my 50 1.8 focuses more consistently, although now quickly.  I am learning to live with it, given all of its other positives.

This lens is just what I was looking for.  I purchased a D80 with a pretty typical kit lens with the clear understanding that low light conditions were going to be a problem.  I had every intention of getting a nice wide aperture prime to compliment the kit lens as soon as possible. The Sigma 30mm is a great lens.  The focal length is good for the distances you'll often encounter inside.  You may have to frame things using your feet but for normal indoor shots I haven't found this to be a problem.  I've taken many great evening shots outside as well.  A good external flash can help out a lot on many shots but being able to capture a subject using the ambient light is definitely still my preference.  Sunsets and moon rises look great too. Autofocus is as good as can be expected.  With the lens wide open the camera can have trouble getting just the right focus because the depth of field gets so small.  So be prepared to adjust for this as needed.  The lens is sharp but wide open you have to be aware that someone's eyes might appear soft focus because the lens is focused on their nose.  If you don't like it then get a nice flash and use a smaller aperture. The lens feels good on the camera and has met my expectations.  I took several hundred shots with it on a recent trip in a variety of lighting conditions and settings and was very happy with the results.  Generally I put it on the camera in the evening and the kit zoom lens on during the day.

I love this lens! If you're looking for the 50mm focal length (equiv.) on your crop sensor camera, this lens is perfect! Sigma Primes are very impressive and I'm the proud owner of this lens and the 50mm f/1.4 Sigma. This 30mm f/1.4 gives you roughly the same field of view as a 50mm lens on a full frame camera. Comes with lens hood, so there's really no need for a UV filter as protection for the front element unless you're overly cautious and don't care about ghostly reflections in complicated lighting situations. Auto-Focus is fast and accurate and full time Manual adjustments can be made.  Bought this lens in New York to use for Street Photography and fell in love with it immediately! When I got home, I tried it on my full frame camera and was still impressed with its center sharpness, but the harsh vignette is a little distracting except in certain circumstances... This lens is made for crop censors and say so, but it does fit onto a full frame body unlike the Canon EF-S lenses. If you have only a crop camera and want the equiv of a 50mm lens, Get this 30mm f/1.4! If you have both crop and full frame cameras, you may want to use the money on something that works on both bodies!

This is a great lens for photographers who want to deal in f/1.4 apertures without the insane pricetag that normally accompanies that class of lenses. It's the perfect balance of lens for mere mortals looking to go deeper with their skills.  Bokeh is simply stunning, color/tone is nominal, and the AF is fairly snappy as well.  As with many lenses like this, it can be a little soft as you spend time at or near f/1.4 and doesn't truly reach its tack sharp sweet spot until about f/4. What can I say, I love this thing.  Many of my best wedding images and most cherished family portraits have come through this lens that over the last several years.  I will note that more than a little paint has rubbed or chipped off over the last 3 years of use. Not enough to drop it a star in my opinion, but it's worth mentioning. One nice thing is that for such great optics, this little lens is fairly lightweight.  It doesn't feel "cheap", but it isn't a brick that makes your wrists & back sore either.  It's a goto lens for me - kind of what I would hope the 50mm would be if it weren't so tight with the DX crop factor.

I tried four copies; three were bad, one was awful.  This lens has been very favorably reviewed, and I find their 50 f1.4 to be magnificent, so I took a chance.  The only thing I can think, based on what I saw in the files, is that in each case, one or more of the elements was out of alignment, because they didn't produce a normally focused image at any focus distance.  Something 10 feet away on one side would be in focus, and something fifty feet away on the other side would be.  Very strange.

WIth hundreds of reviews already, I'll try not to be too redundant. Fast, low light performance. Nice bokeh. Most of the reviews cover the variations between the different camera's that this lens is made for. I've used this lens on the Canon Rebel XT 8MP, and the Canon EOS 50D. The main reason for purchase was the APS-C (Crop Sensor) requires you to step back quite a bit when trying to capture wide shots. I was looking to regain the more normal view of prior film based 50mm lenses that I was so happy with in the past. This is particularly fantastic bokeh if that is the effect you are after. As others have mentioned the thin depth of field can be your best friend or your worst enemy. My purpose for sharing this review is to aid the people looking for that better indoor lens for low light action. Most school gymnasiums have terrible lighting for photography. This lens captures action quite nimbly. It is also great for portraits that you have composed properly with regard to the sharp and soft portions of the frame. I've found great difficulty keeping shots crisp enough when shooting without a tripod, especially with group shots, so you'll have to make that determination for yourself. F2.0 and above gives sharp shots. Corners usually require some post work unless you have enough light to suit a F4.0 at 400 ISO. There is a learning curve with this lens. It can deliver, but it requires time and patience to get the most of it. It is an excellent addition to a series of prime lenses, but if you are trying to find a versatile, do it all lens for shots that you can zoom with your feet, you may find yourself better served by the Canon 50mm 1.4 or even the 50mm 1.8 lens. Having all of these lenses I've found that I rarely use my 30mm lens. The 50mm is versatile enough in most instances. What is even more surprising is that the 50mm is actually cheaper. If you would like to see a fantastic comparison of lens sharpness between various lenses and camera bodies, you may find this link very useful. [...] Bryan Carnathan's in depth reviews and real world samples are extremely helpful when trying to decide if a particular lens made for canon is right for you. This guy takes great pictures with any lens though. The lens charts are really amazing although you do have to consider the variations in lenses that anyone of us may actually receive. He'll tell you if he had to send it back and try again with any lenses that are not performing properly right out of the box. Bottom line, know why you want 30mm, and if that will suit your purpose for the $400 plus dollars. You may find that your dollars could be better applied toward a more expensive L zoom, or just better spent on a similarly priced prime of equal or close focal range. Either way, make sure you get a good filter to help limit internal condensation that will form on the back of the front glass on these non weather proofed lenses. I've had both these lenses factory serviced for internal spots due to condensation. That was when I realized I had better get a good filter.

I purchased 3 copies of this lens from Amazon and not a single one focused properly. I did extensive testing of all 3 versions and all exhibited some amount of backfocusing. I tested the lenses with a focus chart using the center focus point. I also tested them in real-world situations. In all cases the lens failed to focus where I intended. I know that good copies of this lens exist, but I don't know how many more hoops I can jump through to try and get one.

When I purchased my Canon XTi* a year ago, I skipped the kit lens and bought this lens together with two other lenses* instead. I was a bit concerned at first since there are many posts about focusing issues with this lens on the web. Luckily, my copy performs really well. To my (hobbyist) eyes, it focuses accurately and creates sharp images with great color. The narrow depth of field it offers is really fun to play with. It is my default walk-around lens, but I do find it less useful outdoors during the day than indoors. On XTi, its field of view is close to what a 50 mm is on 35mm film camera. This perspective together with its large aperture is really good for taking pictures indoors except when you own a really big house. In that case, you probably could afford a pricier lens like the 35 L* and should not be reading this review. :P I enjoyed this lens even more with the arrival of my daughter. I used it to photograph the birth and growth of my precious girl. The ability to shoot everything without using flash is a great. I just set my camera to ISO 400, continuous shooting, the lens to f/2 and fire away. The fast and quiet HSM motor also helps not to disturb my daughter as much when she is about to fall asleep. 4 stars for everyday use and 5 stars to taking pictures of babies. * XTi Body only: * The other two lenses: -? -? * 35 L for the rich:

This lens is awesome for the price.  I can't get over how well it performs in low light over the Canon 50mm 1.8 that I had been using.  The Canon was too soft at 1.8 to be useful, but the Sigma is noticeably sharper at 1.4.  To sweeten the deal, Amazon is running a special on this lens right now, so the Sigma is a good $60 less than the Canon 28mm 1.8.  In my opinion, if you don't think you will ever need (or be able to afford) a full frame camera, the Sigma is the way to go.  It's quite sharp wide open (especially compared to the Canon 50mm) and has full-time manual focusing.  The lens I received did not appear to have any focusing issues, but I will be sure to update this review if I notice anything.  If you have a crop Canon and don't plan on upgrading to a full frame, get the Sigma and don't look back.  It should be noted that I have not used the Canon 28mm 1.8 to compare, but if it's better than the Sigma, hats off to Canon because the Sigma is great!

I have had the Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens for a couple of months and I love it. It is on my Nikon 300s. Its performance in low light is amazing, group pictures indoors are lush without the washed out appearance of on camera flash units. Some reviews knock its focus, and assuming the lens not defective,I believe these reviews miss an important point. Focus is the responsibility of the autofocus system on the camera. Where this lens excels, i.e. low light, difficult situations, the lens may just be outperforming the camera's autofocus system's ability to get a good reading. The 300s handles it beautifully at all apertures. The problem may lie with the camera's inability to fine tune the focus in darker settings. Also, when the lens (any lens) is wide open, the depth of field is very narrow when focusing close. For about 20-25% of the cost of a 1.8 Nikon, this lens is a bargain. Mine came from Amazon and carries a 4 year warranty too. Highly recommended.

One of the best lenses you can buy for your Canon  crop camera.(20/30/40D or any of the Rebels)Many people report problems with this lens but like Jim Hunt said in another review, I believe most of the focusing errors are operator errors. Prime lenses and especially prime lenses in the "normal" range have very few moving parts and are far less likely to have mechanical issues. That said, I love this lens. I have moved on to a full frame camera so I can no longer use it. For the money  the Sigma 30mm is one of the best lenses you can buy. One reason I believe so many people report having problems with this lens is the price brings it into the affordable range for the amateur photographer or student photographer. These are the photographers that are least likely to understand Depth of Field, and the least likely to do proper testing and evaluations.  Therefore I believe there are some errors sure, but they are not the fault of the equipment.

Works beautifully with my Canon 7D and worked perfectly with my old 40D. Creates crisp images with a beautiful Bokeh that enhances the subject.

I have had this lens for awhile, and first let me give you a little of a background of who I am and what I do. Currently I work for a University and shoot with all pro-canon camera's and glass (1D and L series glass). Then my personal gear is a 7D and 50D 70-200 2.8, 10-20 and the 30 1.4 + flashes and studio strobes. I shoot mainly sports for work and that has moved into my personal photography and because of that I prefer a faster shutter speed to reduce any movement blur in an image. This lens has allowed me to shoot in the dead of night with minimal lighting and come out with some amazing pictures.  This lens will allow you to get shots that people will wonder how you got them. I have read about front focusing issues and it has to do with them shooting at 1.4 and it is very hard to get a shot in focus especially if you or your subject is moving. I have shot sports with this lens for fun at 1.6 and 1.4 I know any shot that I get in focus is partly lucky but when a shot is in focus is it just unreal with color and vibrance. This lens has saved me many times over the past year and is a great walk around lens. Ps this lens will fit on a 1D body and will shoot, there is a minimal vignetting around the edges (1.3 crop factor), but if you are shooting with a 1D you can afford canon's more expensive lenses... If you have any questions about the lens feel free to ask!

After previously owning the Nikon 35mm f/1.8, I picked this up and have been using it for a few weeks. Overall, I am very happy with it considering that it's a f/1.4 and relatively inexpensive. The AF isn't as quick as the Nikon but it's not very much slower. It has been quick enough to capture every shot I've needed. Pros: Having that extra stop is huge. In really low-light situations, it's allowed me to get crisper pictures. Been able to keep ISO fairly low (800/1600) in hand-held situations. It also feels well-constructed. Cons: Limited range. Obviously this is a fixed lens (no zoom). I'm still on the fence on whether I would rather have a 30mm or 35mm (45mm / 52.5mm after crop-factor). I think I'm leaning towards the 35mm since it seems more practical, but I would still rather have the Sigma due to that extra stop.

I bought this lens after using the Nikon 50mm 1.8. The 50mm was just a little too long for my purposes (but I still love it). I was leery to purchase this lens because of the mixed reviews about quality. I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know if I just got a "good" copy of this lens or what but it is as sharp as any lens I have ever used (and sharper than some). The only thing that bothers me a little is that is doesn't seem to focus as close as i would like sometimes. This isn't enough to stop me from using the lens. It's on my camera (Nikon D7000) a majority of the time. I am a professional photographer. I use a bunch of Sigma EX lenses (70-200mm 2.8, 18-50mm 2.8 and 30mm 1.4). The build quality of these lenses is great. They are solid, professional lenses. I would recommend this lens without hesitation.
5
If one does a bit of online research about this Sigma lens, the general positive comments about this lense are sometimes colored by comments of a poor auto-focus or lack of a consistently reproduceable auto-focus on a subject.  While I've not subjected the lense I purchased to a rigorous test chart imaging, in the 30+ days since receiving this lense I have only good things to say about it.  The lense was purchased for interiors and low light exterior photography + HDR imaging.  While I use it in the Manual focus mode for HDR imaging, the auto focus on this lense, coupled with the Canon 20D focusing points, never have disappointed in getting the subject of the photo sharply resolved.  If you've a Cannon with an APS-C sensor for low light photography this Signma lens provides exceptional quality for its cost.

This is a great lens, esp for crop dslr's. I have tried the 'nifty fifty', the 40mm F2.8 STM, and a handful of manual focus prime lenses. The Canon 40mm F2.8 STM is a beautiful ultra compact lens that serves well for portraits but with the crop factor it is like using a 65mm. The 30mm is close to normal as you can get on a crop dslr. It is an affordable prime lens that grabs focus quickly and is sharp and contrasty. Sigma introduced newer "Art" lenses and I have read good things but I could not justify the price difference from the 'older' 30mm F1.4 (purchased from warehouse deals). The build quality is on-par with other Sigma lenses. I photographed inside a church and while it's not particularly wide...it forces the user to move around and be more creative.
5
I have the Sigma HSM version of this lens, using it on a Nikon D40x. The Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens is not easy to use, but that is down to the unique characteristics of an extreme wide aperture lens - the user needs to understand photography technique well to get the most out of this type of lens. Once that is done, i.e. you know what you are doing, the lens is fun to use. Great capabilities in low light and takes great pics wide open. Is fine in daylight, but that isnt what you get it for really. The build quality is rock solid and it comes with a nice lens bag too. HSM works very smoothly and quietly A highly recommended purchase. The Sigma 30mm f1.4 isnt going to be the only lens you use or your main lens, but will be a valued and cherished friend nonetheless.
5
This lens is my favorite to use with my Canon 7D....I usually use my canon 50mm f1.8 to take portrait pictures but now with this lens that has a wider view and looks like my 50mm in regard to the DOF I use it almost all the time...This lens has a sweet BOKEH and it is pretty sharp in the center of the image.... Oh!,  and for filming is a jewel...I want to record everything around me with this lens. Good quality construction, it feels strong. It has a little weird effect sometimes...maybe some chromatic aberration? when light colors meet the dark colors on the DOF portion of the image. In general, you will enjoy this lens with your canon 7D. (use it from f2.0 onwards to get good quality and sharp images)
5
This lens is the sharpest that I own and until I purchase the sigma 70-200 2.8 OS it will be my PRIMARY portrait lens from candid shots of my kids to wedding and portrait jobs. I shoot with the Canon 7D,50mm 1.8 (sold it  because it was a bit too narrow for indoor shots and also that the sigma 30mm 1.4's colors and bokeh are sweeter and has sharper images), 18-135 Canon and the Tokina 100mm 2.8 macro lens. The DOF @ 1.4 is verry narrow and with proper shooting technique 80-95 % of my portrait shots are tack sharp where ever I focus,F2 upwards is mind boggling sharp,F4 is unreal.If you want your portrait photography to sky rocket to another level then invest in this baby. NOTE..THIS IS NOT A FULL FRAME LENS

I have beena photographer for over 40 years, including serious professional work when I was younger.  I used Leica M-series cameras, with the 35 and 50 Summicrons, and the 24 and 90 elmarits.  These are all SHARP, and better than anything Nikon ever made - until recently.  I borrowed a Sigma 30 from a friend, and liked it so much I bought it!  It equals my 17-55 in resolution, and the color is better.  Since the 17-55 rivals all my old Leitz lenses, this is high praise, indeed.  Perfect at 6.3-8.0, but still impressive wide open.  Good build quality, much lighter than the old Nikon 35 f1.4. Equals the 35 f2 Summicron, and costs just $100 more than the plastic Nikon 50 f1.4.
5
I love this lens. I waited about a year to write a review because I didn't want to be caught in the honeymoon phase of a new lens. This Sigma is undoubtedly my favorite to use. I like the fixed aspect of it and the F1.4 really opens up the creativity. Pros: F1.4 - Allows for clear indoor pictures. Bokeh is beautiful and sharp. Focus is quick and accurate Crisp and sharp images Compact Inexpensive for the quality (I bought foor $249) Perfect focal length for copped cameras (gets you a "true 50MM" view I'd be happy to take a picture of something and email it to you if you want to see examples!
5
I struggled with deciding between this lens, the Canon 35, and the Canon 28 1.8.  In the end I went to the Sigma and am LOVING it.  This thing finds light, focus is spot on, wide open looks great to me, colors look gorgeous, comes with a hood...  It's performance is beyond what I had expected.
5
Lots of glass, which makes the lens a tad heavy. Depth of field is impressive. I haven't experienced the focusing problems that some other people have described. Overall, this is a great lens for relatively dark and/or indoor lighting. As expected with f/1.4, the bokeh is just gorgeous.
5
I just want to share my experience with this lens.  I love this lens so much.  Ive been using it since last October and the quality  and sharpness of the pictures is so impressive.  I got Canon 135 F2 and Fisheye Nikon and 70 200 F2.8 Nikon but this is my favorate of all.  So bright and sharp.  Don't look back get this if you like quality prints, this lens is the best of its class.

This was the second lens I ever purchased. When I first purchased it, I had a Canon T2i. It worked decently on that camera, but I had to manually focus it for the best results because it frequently front focused when auto-focusing This is known issue with Sigma lenses. However, I only noticed the front focus if I was at really fast apertures. If I was stopped down a bit, it wasn't enough to notice. I then upgraded my camera to a 7D. The 7D has a micro-adjust feature that lets you fine tune the auto-focus adjustment of each lens. It was obvious my lens was slightly off calibration as it needed a pretty big adjustment. The camera allows me to adjust the focus point closer or further away from the camera. I had to adjust it 10 points away (to compensate for the front focus). The range is only 20 in each direction, so this was half of the range, which is somewhat big. I do have to say, after getting the 7D and micro-adjusting the lens, this is now my favorite lens when I don't need zoom. If I'm mounting a lens to mess around and take photos of my friends and what not, this is the lens. It is impressively sharp at the center wide open. Once you start stopping down, this thing becomes unbelievably sharp! It will jump out and cut you if you aren't careful. I have not really been in a situation where I needed the corners of the frame to be sharp, but my friend did complain that the corners are a bit soft wide open and did not improve all that much when stopped down. I cannot personally comment but I trust my friend's photographic ability so I figured I'd mention it. Now, I would have given it 4 stars due to the front focusing but that's not pertinent to my requirements anymore, since it was fixed when I got the 7D. Also, when I had my T2i and I contacted Sigma service they said I could send the lens in with my body and they would be happy to calibrate the lens specifically to the body. Because of the great customer service and the sheer capability of the lens at such a great price, I've left it as a 5 star review, but I do warn that if you purchase this lens you should have a micro-adjust equipped body or be prepared to send it in for calibration.
5
I've used this lens countless times and almost always have it on my camera.  It's my favorite as it allows me to get close up to something I want or far back without having to deal with a zoom.  The picture is always clear, the f/1.4 is great for indoors.

I've had this lens for about a year and a half now.  The lens itself is small and easy to carry in a camera bag.  I can confirm that it's also very sharp.  When it's manually focused it can be incredibly sharp, but unfortunately the auto-focus is inconsistent and will often front-focus (i.e. the red auto-focus dot will light up on an object, but the picture ends up focusing on something slightly closer than the object supposedly in focus).  I've done testing on a tripod and compared it against manually focusing the lens and I confirmed the issue does exist.  I've read, however, that Sigma has issues with consistency and quality control sometimes, so it's entirely possible I just got a bunk lens and that others will be fine.  Note that Sigma reverse-engineers the auto-focus systems from Canon/Nikon/etc. because those manufacturers don't provide data sheets on how to interface with the camera, so Sigma's lenses *are* more prone to error than the "native" lenses, and I'm certainly not the only one to have this error. More about the lens: at f/1.4 the contrast is a little weak and it's not as sharp as if you stop it down a little more (to say f/2.8), but it's still better than most zoom lenses at any aperture. At f/2.8 or higher, everything is in perfect focus.  This lens has the potential to be the perfect prime lens because it's the equivalent to a standard ~50mm lens after the multiplier of cropped sensor cameras like the 40D/30D/20D and XSi/XTi/XT, plus at f/1.4 it's great in low light.  But with poor auto-focus, the lens becomes far less useful than it otherwise would be.  Using manual focus it's perfect, though.
5
This lens takes very clear images, its extremely fast and offers low-light image taking. I am using this lens exclusively right now because it offers so much flexibility between indoor and outdoor lighting.
5
Received this lens about 1 hour ago, and, promptly started my testing, since there were so many focus issues, both with Amazon, and other web sites... The first setting I made, after attaching the lens, was to set the focus to spot... This was done to allay any miss-cues due to the very narrow focal plane at 1.4... I shot about 50 to 60 shots, both inside, flash and none, and outside on a bright sunny day - all at 1.4 and 2.0 f-stops... As I take about half of my photos of flowers, I had been using spot focus for several months, due to many out-of-focus shots with auto focus... With the Sigma 30mm 1.4,  I were  nary a single front or back focus to be seen, only sharp photos... Outside did require an 8000 shutter speed ad 1.4 though...  Had to make sure the lens was perfect, as I wanted to take advantage of Amazon's 30 day return, and it is a Christmas present for myself... (will tell the wife later) The soft focus I noticed at 1.4 and 2.0 were not overly apparent on my 25.5 inch monitor, had to really look for it... This lens is as sharp, or sharper than the kit lens (28-135 EF-S) that came with my Canon 60D, and I really did need the extra light for inside photos... I would imagine this lens will be on my camera about 75% of the time...

I just wanted to chime in on one point.  I rented this lens, because I was looking for (i) a prime lens, (ii) at the 1.4 speed (fast), (iii) for taking pictures at parties (read: low low light), and (iv) that would autofocus in the D60.  I have the D60.  The D60 comes with a fine kit lens, but at f3.5 it is just not fast enough for shooting real people in low light. When I took this 30mm to a bar though ...  the AF never locked.  Never.  I had to switch to manual mode to get anything at all.  This may be "no big deal" to some, but the 50mm AF Nikon f1.4 lens (which is manual-only on the D40/40x/60) can do the same trick for more than $100 less.  I am not sure if this is the "autofocus issue" other have spoken about, but I can verify that there are times in low light where my kit lens locks-on, but the 30mm Sigma does not.  Disappointing for a lens that I personally consider a little pricey (no comments from pros on my high level of price-sensitivity please). In real light, the lens is great.  Nice soft focus and shallow depth of field.  At night though, it is manual-focus or nothing in my experience. Personally, I recommend renting the lens first to be sure it suits your needs. In fact, that is good advice for all lenses that you personally consider pricey (your sensitivity to price may vary).  For me, I am waiting to try the just-announced  50mm AF-S Nikon f1.4 which is due out for Christmas 2008 (and is virtually the same price as this lens).

I was looking to buy a lens in this focal range, and eventually it came down to the choice between this lens, Canon 28mm 1.8 and Canon 35mm (not the L one, obviously).  I decided against 35mm due to its bokeh and the lack of USM, and ordered Canon 28 and Sigma 30 to test.  I got both lens "used as new", Sigma - from Amazon.  I don't know if it was sheer lack, or the fact that my lens was used (and therefore calibrated by previous owner), but I did not experience any front or back focus issues with Sigma that a lot of other users report. However, I've heard so many people say that Sigma 30 is SO SUPERIOR to Canon 28, that I was expected to notice a huge difference.  Yes, I would say that Sigma 30 is slightly better than Canon - the bokeh is slightly smoother, and the focus seemed slightly sharper.  But the lenses are very very comparable, and both became easily overcome by the bright light (got more washed out skies with both of these than with my Canon 85mm). In the end, I decided to keep Canon.  Sigma's advantage was so minimal, that I just could not justify keeping it, given that it's for crop-cameras only.  Not that I plan to get a FF camera any time very soon, but I love my primes, and when I do get a FF, I will likely not have the budget for L-grade primes for a very very long time, so I like to invest in lenses that will last me a while, and not until I upgrade (especially when they are the same price, almost to the dollar).

Photographers expect excellent image quality from a prime - contrast, color, bokeh, and sharpness. This lens delivers on each front, with one partial exception: the Sigma 30 delivers excellent center sharpness even at f/1.4, but it has poor edge and corner sharpness. This makes it a great short portrait lens, but a poor landscape lens. It delivers the contrast and color needed for landscapes, but if output at large sizes, you'll notice the edge and corner weakness. To be clear, you won't notice the weakness when taking portraits; at least I didn't, with the exception of group shots. I wish I could post the examples here. If you go to Flickr, my username is designosophy and I've tagged a bunch of photos Sigma 30 1.4. One other thing to keep in mind is the Pentax version of the lens does not have HSM for some reason, but doesn't cost any less than the other mounts. Annoying, Sigma. I also have the Sigma 50 f/1.4, which does have HSM. It has similar bokeh, contrast, and color to the 30, but it has HSM and better edge/corner sharpness. The 30 beats the 50 in center sharpness, however. The 30 is truly a center-optimized lens.

Since I use this with my Rebel t4i, the crop factor produces a 50mm equivalent which is a perfect focal length. I have a Canon 50mm 1.4 but I have a hard time using it in a small room.  This lens works much better in composing the shot especially in low light AND taking videos as it is really bright.  The 17-50 is also good but the 1.4 wins hands down in low light. We had a casino night for our christmas party and I took all pictures without flash and the pictures are all awesome.  the bokeh is excellent, the pictures are sharp, just amazing that words can't describe.  And all the pictures are keepers even if they are just normal shots, they look very professional. I have been taking pictures mostly with this and it is fun walking back and forth to compose shots that I do not miss my 17-50 tamron vc.  I am thinking of returning the tamron now as it is not video compatible with t4i.  I might get the sigma 17-70 instead just so I have a zoom lens. I got this during the holiday promo for $350, so totally worth the price.

Bought this lens for indoor photography on my D40.  As-received lens had significant front focus problem so returned to Sigma for calibration. Came back much improved with the only issue being repeatability.  The same thing happens with the kit lens; comparing 55mm at f/5.6 and 18mm at f/3.5 shows the subject is more likely to be re-acquired (and focus less repeatable) when at 18mm at f/3.5 and less forgiving with the shallow DOF. With the Sigma at f/1.4 it's even worse, also seems that a UV filter messes with AF even more so I don't use one.  Given the how the AF compares with the kit lens I don't believe AF repeatability is the Sigma lens' fault but a limitation of the camera's AF mechanism.  I have a Haoda focus screen on order to touch up the AF when required (easy to correct AF just by grabbing the Sigma focus ring when if AF-S mode).  I would have given the lens four stars but there is nothing else that compares to it.  Build quality is excellent and SIgma customer service outstanding.  There is apparently a good chance of having to send a new lens back back to Sigma for AF calibration based on what body someone intends to use it on; works great on my D40 now but front focuses on a friend's D200 and D300 (at the D300 default setting).

I recently purchased this Sigma 30mm lens for low light/indoor-No Flash, and general use photography. It seems, thus far, to deliver in every respect. I can't complain at all. Perhaps others have experienced quality control issues with this lens, but I haven't. My sample auto focuses accurately as far as I can tell. I made sure I purchased direct from Amazon.  My pics are sharp and highly contrasted. This lens kicks butt on the Nikon packaged lens (18-55mm). I've taken about 450 photos so far - Indoor and out, in many different lighting situations, and even at times with the built in flash firing, and I can honestly highly recommend this lens. I have several other lenses, all nikon "D" type, and although they are very good, this lens is just "BETTER". On the negative side, you are limited to the equivalent of a 50mm focal length in the 35mm film camera format - No Zoom - But for indoors, and low light, and relatively close distance people shots, this lens rocks - believe me. I did a lot of research before I bought this one, and it paid off. If you're sitting on the fence with this one like I was, and you want the performance this offers for the same reasons I purchased it for, wait no more - buy it ......

wow...all i can say is wow...great lens, with available 30mm wide angle and super fast f/1.4...what more can i say...love it, would recomment to anyone

I've waited for a year to finally review this lens.  I have not had any problems with the focus.  I have conducted some focus tests and it's right on (I did own another sigma lens with some of the focus issues).  The lens is very sharp.  It's the perfect focal length for 1.6 type sensors (as it is designed for), if you want that "old 50mm prime feel".  It is my primary prime lens (I also own the canon 85 1.8).  I've taken thousands of pictures with it and I'm ready to weigh in. I can compare it to the build and quality of the canon 85, which I would say is superior to the sigma in terms of overall quality.  That said, I love this lens.  It comes with an excellent case and hood, and it is very solid (maybe even too heavy?). If you're looking for that narrow depth of field, low light crisp, blurry background picture - this is it.  Turn your camera to "Av" setting and kiss your flash goodbye!  The sigma 30mm is a solid, crisp, all around winner.  Well worth the $.

Bought this for my Nikon D40. Very fast, sharp wide open, and perfect focal length for me for indoor shots. For the cost, its can't be a bad buy.

I had a Sigma kit lens years ago that was atrocious.  My initial impression of Sigma glass was therefore not that great.  But this lens continued to get rave reviews, so when the price dropped to below USD300, I bit. I knew if I got a lemon I could send it back to Amazon. I've had this lens a week now and have taken a variety of photos and I must say I am impressed.  My copy focuses with no problem. No issues with vignetting or chromatic abrasion.  The only time I have trouble focusing is in low light. What I also like is the lens' lightness.  This is a featherweight among lenses.  This makes it easier to haul around for day jobs.  The added hood and the convenient carrying case is also a plus.  The case fits in my camera bag for added padding.  Why can't Canon provide this type of case for their L lenses? My one gripe is that the lens cover pops off too easily. UPDATE 2-19-13  The lens started having problems focusing.  The lens would try to find a focal point and couldn't.  So I turned the auto-focus off and used the manual.  That still got it to work, but with my one bad eye, I rely  on AF.  I docked one star.

I needed a 'normal' lens for my Sony a350 DLSR. I have a few zoom WA lenses that work well but sometimes it is nice to just put on a normal prime lens and let your legs do the 'zooming'. This lens is the latest (I think) Sigma 30 mm (45 mm full frame equivalent), f 1.4 EX DC prime lens. After testing it on several garden activities I'm pleased with the results. This lens is very sharp except at f 1.4 and then it's a little soft at the edges. Stopping down to f 4.0 & beyond produced very sharp images w/o distortion. The photos are stunning !! Autofocus was not a problem. Just make sure to use the proper focus zone (I use center spot to focus on what I want to see in the photo). This lens is somewhat expensive compared to some other f 1.4 prime lenses but well worth the money. This lens will stay on my camera unless there's a special reason to need one of the zoom's.

I've had a few days to try this lens out with my 7D and I must say, I'm very impressed. The build quality is solid, it feels sturdy. I will say the focusing ring isn't as 'smooth' as a USM lens from Canon, but, it functions well. I've gotten some beautiful pictures from it already. This lens is a must have for crop sensor cameras, particularly if you use it in low light. The 1.4f requires some getting used to, but, once you get a feel for the depth of field, you can really come up with some stunning images. I haven't had any problem focusing, though sometimes with such a shallow DOF all the way open it can be tricky..  There's always a degree of fuzziness, but, that's to be expected. Truth be told, even at 1.4 it takes beautiful images that can be sharp where you need them to be- if you practice a bit with it. Obviously it's a little easier when you get around 1.8 or 2.0, but, I've been very pleased with it at ANY aperture. Beautiful bokeh, and wonderful performance in low light.

Some points I want to share with those who are planning to purchase the lens for a Nikon body: 1. Both lens I received have autofocus issue in the VF mode and both generate soft images. 2. Both lens have almost no autofocus issue in the LV mode, and generate sharp images most of the time even at F/1.4. 3. After obtain the second lens with the same problem (AF), I realize that this is not a QA problem. 4. Sent the second lens to Sigma (with my camera body). Sigma said that they had uploaded the Nikon firmware to the   lens. Sigma sent the lens/camera back to me within 48 hrs after they received them. 5. Lens came back with better AF. 6. Sharp above F2.8. 7. Do not buy a "used" or "like new" one, because you do need the four year warranty (for future calibration). 8. Do not send the lens back to Amazon, because you will generate more "like new" lens. 9. If I have a choice again, I will go with the Nikon f/1.8.........

I bought this lens for my D40 (for $375), but ended up returning it. At the time, it was the only auto focusing 30mm prime available for the D40. Upon receiving the lens, I shot with it for a week but kept noticing my focus wasn't quite right. This was much more noticeable in some shots than others. In addition, the lens added a yellow cast to my images. After doing some research, it turns out the Sigma 30mm f1.4 is known to have both focus and cast issues. After doing more extensive tests with a focus chart, it was very apparent my lens was backfocusing about .3-.5". Not good. I could have sent it to Sigma to re-calibration, but for that much money, no thanks. In fact, I'll be very cautious of every buying a non-Nikon branded lens again. Luckily, Nikon announced it will be selling it's own 35mm f1.8 at the beginning of March 2009. Oh, and what's even better? It's going to be priced at $199 US. Initial reviews have been very good. I've already pre-ordered mine.
5
I haven't shot with a prime lens since my old 35mm film days, and I had forgotten how nice it is to have a really fast lens in the arsenal.  I normally buy Nikor lenses, but was impressed by the great reviews for this Sigma lens, and discouraged by the reviews of the comparable Nikor lens.  I bought the lens primarily for some anticipated low-light night situations that my f3.5 zoom lens isn't up to.  So far, I've shot a number of tests in dim light conditions and am very satisified with the results.  Of course, optical stabilization would be a nice addition, but for it's intended use, it works great. Overall, it feels very solid, it focuses quickly, and is reasonably sharp full open.  Definitely a worthy addition to the zoom lenses. Note: shooting on a D300

Since I purchased this lens, it has been on my Canon 7D 90% of the time. In that time, I've noticed that wide open, it's definitely not tack sharp. A lot of the time it's no where NEAR sharp. I find myself really over-shooting to compensate for the lack of focus when I need it to be wide open at 1.4, just to get one or two shots that are really focused well and sharp. It performs better from f2.8 and up, which kind of defeats the purpose of having such a huge maximum aperture in the first place. It's a great focal length on a crop sensor body, so I'll definitely keep it in my bag, but I've stopped expecting it to hit the focus on the head every time.
5
I purchased this with one thing in mind- to make it my standard carry lens for my EOS 7D and my EOS 500D.  Prior to this, I was carrying a 50mm 1.8II Canon.  The Sigma outshines the Canon in every wide aperture up until 2.8 where there is no difference.  The Sigma makes excellent bokeh wide open, and is extremely useful in low light and indoor photography- even at ISO 100.  The outofocus is responsive and quiet, the manual focus ring is also easy to operate.  I am very happy with this lens. The build is heavy and solid.  The lens diameter is 62mm.  The lens is very attractive on my cameras. This is a very good investment that has produced pleasing results.

I have had this lens now for about a year, it's one my carry arounds, next to the Canon 50mm, The F1.4 is great for any lighting, great build and solid feeling. Sigma EX line is not Canon "L" series but close enough and better than many if not most 3rd party companies that are out there. The focusing is a bit funny at times, but I have a feeling that is because of the lens compared to canon. Overall the images are sharp and of Canon standards. If you need a prime lens to just have fun or even portrait shots, this is the lens for you, without spending the big bucks. there won't be many if at all complaints unless you get a bad one.
5
Many people talk about the back focusing issues, I own the 85 1.2 and have had 2 of the 85's with front focusing issues. It seems to be able to happen to the best of them. As far as the 30 1.4 goes it is a great lens. Mine has no focusing problems. It is super sharp, mine seems to be only slightly less sharp than the 85. I would not worry about the potential focusing issues because at this price it is incredible. If need be send it back and get one without the issue. For this price it is worth it. Obviously this is for a camera with a cropped lens, something to keep in mind.
5
This is an awesome lens.  It has excellent central sharpness wide open at f1.4 and it just keeps getting sharper.  Focus is quiet and smooth and has been very accurate for me.  Focal length is perfect for everyday use on APS-C cameras and you can shoot in just about any light with this lens.  I have shots lit only by campfire, christmas lights, street signs, etc, that would have been impossible at f2.8.  Basically this is the best option for the classic normal prime that many used in the film days and it has always been my favorite lens since the day I bought it.
5
I have only had this lens for 2 weeks, and only used it for one session, (and misc other testing) but this lens definitely packs a punch in quality.  High image quality, 75% were nice and sharp, 20% were tack sharp (and I grade hard), and 5% were a touch soft.  No images were unusable; fantastic when shooting wide open at 1.4! The biggest benefit I found was the lack of chromatic aberration!  I shot during the golden hour with the sun in 75% of my frames and I could not find any chromatic aberration in my images.  This will definitely be my new go to lens on my Canon 7D.
5
Bought this lens after using and breaking the canon nifty fifty after a few months.  I wanted to replace it with something built better, and was prepared to invest a little more in a lens this time around.  I debated heavily between this and the Canon 50mm 1.4, I ultimately decided on this lens because the I found the 50mm to be a bit too long for a lot of the indoor candid shots I use this camera for.  I have been very happy with the results I have received from this lens so far, photos have been pretty sharp even wide open at 1.4.
5
This has been worth every penny.  It provides a wide enough angle, with a super-wide aperture, and a fast focusing motor.  This is also the least-expensive, sub f/2.0 lens worth purchasing for Canon mounts.  The Canon 50mm f/1.8 is a POS.  The photos that this Sigma lens produces in low-light settings are stunning (on my Canon T2i body), making my friends exclaim, "I need to buy the camera you have."  Thanks, I think?  Surely it's all in the gear and not the photographer, but I digress.  :)
5
When I bought this lens it was $489, now it dropped to $289!, too bad that didn't happened like a year ago! Anyway, great lens, totally recommended, for prime lens is everything you need and for video too! I love shooting video with it and the f/1.4 gives you a very professional look! Check out my YouTube channel EduarFilms if anyone is interested in seeing results, I shoot with a T2i and also own a Tokina 11-16mm that is totally recommended as well!
4
I don't shoot with flash, so fast lenses are important to me. I've used this lens for four years, and haven't run into any focusing or other hardware issues. That's just the luck of the draw, I guess. I didn't want to spend the money on a comparable Nikkor lens, and for me, this has worked out. For the last year and a half, it's the lens that's generally already on my husband's camera. So not only is it still working, but it's been stolen from me.
5
This lens is fantastic. Mine is as sharp as any lens I have (including the canon 50/1.8 and 24-105L). Focus is quiet and fast. I won't repeat what others have said, just reporting back that I have a good copy on first try and I wouldn't have any reservations telling a friend to buy this one. Since I've purchased this for my crop camera (Canon 60d), I never use the canon 50 f/1.8. The 50 is just too narrow for indoor use.
2
I had 3 copies of this lens. None of them were focusing correctly. Most of time it will front focus by 1 inch. It's kinda random, hit or miss. It's probably okay for many people but I am spoiled by other good prime lenses. Even when it was in focus, it wasn't sharp enough for me. You get what you paid for. It may work in certain situations like shooting in extremely low light. If you are picky about sharpness and image quality, stay away.
5
All you need to know about this lens is how sharp it is and the bokeh. At first I was hesitant to even purchase this lens due to some buyers having problem with front-focus and replacing theirs; two or even three times. But gave it a try and risk it anyway. Waited 2 weeks though, but it was worth it. Once I got my hand on it, Boom! SHARPNESS, SHARPNESS, SHARPNESS. It's fast and quite. Give it a try and you won't regret it. I promise.
5
I too was worried about the focusing ability of this lens with all the comments on this site and others, but I bought this lens used and it AF focuses perfectly and quickly with virtually no noise. It is the best in low light for "no flash" pictures. I am very happy with it and so glad I took the chance.
4
The housing of this lens is fantastic and looks very professional, fantastically built for ASPC sensors; working awesome with my 60D. It doesn't focus as most explained it would, but it's rare I use auto focus anyways. The Aperture just like itself opens a whole new range of opportunities with lighting, with beautiful bokeh. The only thing I would add to this is some stabilization.
4
This lens is amazing, especially for the price. I shoot with Nikon d5100 and its auto focus ability makes it so much better. I love it, except it does not focus on live-view... or video really. Good thing i normally dont use those. But if you are a portrait/wedding photographer i would recommend it. also this is not for full frame lenses
5
This was a great lens. I took it traveling around SE Asia for 3 weeks and it did the trick. Great for low light and night shots. Really sharp images. The only downfall is that it is a fix lens. Sometimes you don't want to get that close to wildlife for the perfect shot. I bought the lens used and have no regrets.
5
I have tried several lenses on my rebel xt and all though I love my 50 1.4 for single portraits, this lens is amazing.  Super sharp, and has replaced my tamron 17-50mm as my walk around lens.  I do care that it doesn't zoom but when I have to decide sharpness over zoom, sharpness always wins.
5
This is an essential lens in the sigma as system. Sharp,,fast, bright with the right amount of heft and fantastic image quality. 50mm POV with great lens construction.. Waited a long time for this and it does not disappoint! Gonna be better when I  get my own merril cam :)
4
I purchased it for my Sony A77 and it works well!  There are newer models lens come out now but I picked this one because of price. I like to take photo a lot but I'm not a professional.  This will be good enough for me.  So far no complain and it meets all my expectations!
5
Best crop sensor lens for point and shoot photography available. This is a perfect lens for snapping photos of friends at an evening indoor party with low level lighting. Unbelievably sharp when compared with the canon 50 mm L f1.2 lens that is 4 times as expensive.
5
I've been using this lens with my 20D for the past couple of weeks, and it's so much fun that I've hardly used any other lens. I really enjoy the beautiful, smooth background blur that it gives me at f/1.4. And the sharp areas of the photo are very sharp, even wide open at f/1.4. The build quality is solid and the focusing ring is smooth, which is important for those who sometimes wish to manually focus or to use the lens' full-time manual feature to manually adjust focus even when in autofocus mode. I also find the lens to be very resistant to flare, which is great because I enjoy using it to shoot into the light and get a backlit effect on my out-of-focus background. This lens is intended for use only on cameras with APS-C sensors such as the 10D, 20D, 30D, 40D, 50D and digital Rebels, and it gives you a "normal" field of view (similar to the classic 50mm focal length on film cameras). As has been reported here and elsewhere on the web, some copies of this lens have poor autofocus with Canon cameras. The first copy Amazon sent me had erratic autofocus and I returned it. But the replacement copy is superb. And Amazon's returns process is so painless that I felt quite comfortable buying this lens here even though I knew before I bought it that I might not get a perfect one first time. If you are looking for a general purpose, "normal" lens (the equivalent of a 50mm lens on a film camera) and you are not seeking background blurs, you might also want to consider the Canon 28mm f/2.8, which costs about half as much as this lens. But if you want to shoot at a wide aperture with subjects that are relatively close in order to get a beautiful, smooth and out of focus background, look no further -- this is the lens for you, and the quality of the blur is terrific. Update September 2009: I've been using this lens for nine months now and it's still one of my favourite lenses. I recently got a used Canon 5D and I wish I could use it on that too (the lens only works with cameras that have smaller sensors). If Sigma were to release a lens in the 30-35mm range that worked with my 5D and had similar optical characteristics to this one, I would buy it immediately.

I've had this lens for a few months now and LOVE IT. I've always stuck with the Canon-branded lenses and have a little over half a dozen (the 70-200L, 28-135, 18-55 (IS and Non-IS), 50mm 1.8, 85mm 1.8) and have been a bit disappointed with all but the higher-end ones (like the 70-200L). I've also heard very mixed reviews about the 3rd-party lenses like Sigma and Tamron, but decided to give it a chance (the Canons around this range - the 28mm and 35mm - don't rate so high, whereas this one did) Right off the bat - it's not entirely cheap, especially considering its a 3rd-party lens and for digital-only (EF-S cameras, meaning no full frame of 1.3x crop cameras). One nice change compared to Canon though, is that it includes a hood and carrying case (something Canon only includes with their L series lenses). I bought this as a wide(r)-angle lens compared to the 50mm and 85mm - sometimes they're just too much of a reach on a crop-sensor camera sometimes. The 30mm works very nice on compatible cameras - it's very sharp and has that wonderful 1.4 aperture for those low-light or short depth of field shots, and that's where the lens really shines. For sharp shots you'll probably find yourself using 2.2 or higher (although 1.4 is definitely usable and I find myself using it all the time to get that cool look it produces). I've been a photographer for years and some of my best shots have been from this lens - it gives me a look that just isn't possible on any of my other lenses (either because they're too much (50mm), or the aperture is too slow (18-55 / 28-135). For that, it made the lens totally worth it. If you can find a good copy. Now, the problem with Sigma and Tamron is that the lenses can be very hit or miss.. not just in whether a particular lens is good, but if the one you end up with is a good match with your camera. You can buy 5 of these lenses and each one might be different - one might focus perfectly, one might focus behind the subject, some might focus in front of it. At f/8 it's not much of an issue, but at f/1.4, if it focuses half an inch in front of your subject you're out of luck (as at that depth of field, your subject is out of focus). It's not only a matter of getting a "good one", as you might have different results on different cameras.  If you can get a good one, you'll love this lens. My only gripe (besides the big one above of "hoping it works"), are that it's "Digital Only" (EF-S), so it won't work on a camera like a 5D II.  Image Stabilizer would have been awesome as well, but you're already getting an f/1.4 lens (and the IS would drive up the price). Build quality is solid. It doesn't feel like a cheap plastic lens. Image quality is fantastic (I haven't noticed any distortions either). I love the lens and can highly recommend it.

I bought this lens 2 months ago, and since then it has rarely been detached from my camera. I do a lot of portraiture, and it works great for nearly all situations. It's fast and sharp. I love it.
5
I bought this 30 mmm to get more quality on my pics, if you are looking to get a really cool 50 mm photo on a not full frame camera, this is the lens you will need, excellent for my canon 4ti.
5
I have wanted this lens for a long time and couldn't pass it up when Amazon put it on sale. It was delivered as promised and its performance is exactly what I expected. I couldn't be happier.
5
Beautiful results! Not great when super close but, other than that, the photos and video through this lens are magnificent! Worth every penny!!! Canon Rebel T3i
5
This is absolutely the best lens you could buy for a crop sensor DSLR.  48mm perspective at 1.6x (as close to 50mm on a full frame as you'll get)...  really top quality.
4
I've been shooting with this lens for about a year now and finally felt inclined to leave my thoughts. Like most have said, this lens is very soft at 1.4, but notch it a step or two and it sharpens out.  The softness is great in certain situations, but is horrible if your subject is moving a lot (like my 15 month old).  Basically, there is a bit of a learning curve with this lens to really understand how it shoots in different types of situations. This has turned out to be an ideal lens for shooting indoors when there is not a lot of direct sunlight.  For that matter, even during the day my house does not get a lot of light and the speed of the lens is certainly a benefit. I dont' think this lens replaces some of the glass for twice it's price, but it is great considering what it does cost. Finally, the lens does have some weight behind it, but it really seems balanced on my D-70. Happy shooting!
5
My new favorite lens! Great quality! Produces such beautiful images! Couldn't have made a better decision for my portrait photography!
5
Easy to use in low-light situations, light, silent and overall a very nice product which yields excellent photos. Recommend it
4
the auto focus is snappy.  i'm very pleased with the pictures produced with this lens.  I would recommend you buy this product.
5
If you're in the market for a fast lens for low light conditions this is a great buy.  With a F/1.4, it captures a lot of light.  Together with the twilight mode of the Sony, I never have to use a flash indoors.  This allows me to take more candid shots without breaking the mood or washing out a scene with a bright flash. I use this for my Sony A55. The AF is quick and fortunately for me, I do not have any front focus issues that I have been reading about from other reviews.  The lens creates a pleasing bokeh and makes for great portrait shots. The lens is rather heavy compared to the 18-55mm kit lens, but I'm not too bothered by that considering the excellent shots I get from it.  Overall, I very happy with my purchase and always carry this in my camera bag.
5
This lens is perfect for portraits and low light condition. It is well built and comes with a hood. Very pleased!
4
It's small and light. 30mm/1.4 on a 1.6x crop factor is ideal for indoor photography when you lack space and light. Image quality is not the sharpest (especially wide open) but good enough for non professional photography. I find that I have to correct and increase color saturation almost all the time when post processing photos taken with this lens. I could only compare it to Canon's 50mm/1.4 (I know it's a different length and use) but that's the closest I was able to try (at this price range). The canon is sharper and the colors are much more vibrant. The bokeh produced by the canon lens looks better to me. Again, since it's a different length it can't be used in the same places as the sigma. Overall it's a nice and humble lens that helps you make the shot instead of missing it.
5
This is a great little lens for the price. I have gotten loads of use out of it. The pictures come out great!
4
I use this lens on an EM1 with a M4/3 mount.  This is my go to lens because I love the 30mm focal length (60mm on a FF) and the extra brightness I get from a F1.4; the price is very nice as well.  It's not the fastest AF or sharpest lens compared to the native options on an M4/3, but it's no slouch either (see sample pictures).  There are a few other lenses that give you F1.4, but not at this focal length and price.  Also, since the EM1 offers PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) for Four Thirds lenses, I like having a lens in my camera bag that gives me another AF option.  With the M4/3 conversion mount, this lens gets a bit bulky, but it's still way lighter than carrying around a FF DSLR.  When I'm wanting to travel without my entire arsenal, it's this and the Olympus 12-50mm F2.8.

I bought the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 to use in low light situations and it typically does not disappoint. It does tend to hunt if there is little light on the subject and it does have front focusing issues. That being said, it is a great lens for the money. The bokeh is quite good and once you get a little practice with it the images you get can be awesome. I walked around with this lens on my camera for about a week and was able to get some terrific images with it. I also have a 50mm f/1.8 and like this one better because it allows me to get closer to the subject. I also have the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8, which is almost always on my camera. The Sigma 30mm f/1.4 is definitely my second favorite lens.

I love this lens, it works perfectly for me.  I have this lens for the Canon mount, and have had no issues with any of the three Sigma lenses I have bought for my Canon so far.  I took this lens to the caverns to take some photos, and think they turned out great for what I wanted.  Im sure if you decide to do some pixel peeping you can find some faults, but honestly as long as they look good on my computer screen I am perfectly happy.  Inside the caverns I had no issues with the lens locking onto focus. Granted the caverns were lit, but it was not super bright light.  If you are looking for a good lens that would be equivalent to the 50mm on a crop sensor, I would recommend this lens.

I have been one of the lucky ones who received a good copy. Although I own other lenses, I used to have a Nikon 10-200mm zoom attached to my D300s. Since I receive the sigma 30mm f1.4 this is the one I currently have. No focus issues, fortunately, after intensive check under controlled and field conditions. Yes, it is a bit soft at f1.4 though sharpness increases and is great starting at 2.8. I compared its sharpness to that of my Nikon 105mm micro at f11 (sweetest stop for the 105 in my opinion) and their sharpnes are comparable. Great construction and focus speed. I gambled and were lucky, I think it is worth a try. If you get a good copy you would love this lens.

Came in decent time, looks and works great. I am an extremely satisfied customer :)

Get this lens, learn to shoot manual on a prime focus (if you don't know how already) and see what your camera can REALLY do. The sheer range of this lens blows me away. I have not removed it from my T3i body since its purchase in February. Fast, Sharp, Versatile, Lightweight. What more could you want in a prime? I recommend it for BOTH "street" shooting, and more dedicated, delicate tripod shots. An example of the latter: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2GE6DKHYQCDWH/B0007U0GZM/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link Take the plunge, and take care.

When I bought this lens for my Canon 450D, I did not do enough research about the poor quality of Sigma lenses.  My suggestion is to take a look at Canon's 28mm EF and 35mm lens as possible alternatives to this lens.  Like other reviewers my instance of this lens tends to focus in front of the subject I want and not on the subject.  Thus, resulting in an out of focus/fuzzy picture.  I've been forced to manually focus this lens if I desire my subject to be in focus.  This really reduces the number of photos I can take per given amount of time and the situations where I can use this lens.
5
This lens is an affordable way to get great pictures on a crop body. I mostly shoot in low light, and after being at f/1.4 with this lens, I can't go back to f/3.5+! With this lens, I can take hand held pictures at night without a crazy high ISO. The 30mm focal length is great on a crop sensor. This is used as my walk-around lens, I rarely take it off my Canon 60d. It's pretty sharp but I haven't done any of the print out sharpness tests. I'm happy with it. Now if only there was a light weight, affordable, 15-85mm f/1.4, say, under $1k... ;)
5
This is my first Sigma lens and I was a bit nervous when ordered it. But I was pleasantly surprised with the build quality and sharpness of this lens. I experienced no AF problems. This lens AF as good as any of my Canon lens. It is very usable at f1.4 and becomes extremely sharp if you step it down a couple of steps. The 30mm works extremely well on a crop frame body especially indoors where there is simply not enough room to step back to fit everything in. Oh yeah, I love the fact that it comes with a matching finish hood!
5
Despu?s de muchos reviews, de dudar por no ser una lente full frame, me decid? y compr? esta joyita de la tecnolog?a. La gran apertura que ofrece fue uno de los factores que inclin? la balanza, sea para foto como para video, este lente es un 10. Altamente recomendable, tiene una construcci?n s?lida, incluye el hood y sus prestaciones son impecables. No creo que te arrepientas si eleg?s este producto que enorgullece a la gente de Sigma.

Ever since making the jump from film to digital (APS-C), I have been looking for a lens that replicates the 50mm frame on my Canon 20d and 40d.  Well, this is it.  30mm at a magnification level of 1.6 equals 48mm.  There are other lenses with better optics and more flexibility, and according to some reviews, better quality.  However, at f/1.4, there are not many lenses that are faster.  For anyone missing the 50mm perspective from the old days of analog, this is it in the world of APS-C.
5
Received the lens last night and tested it out today. I'm not sure why people are saying the lens is not usable at 1.4. I tried it out and it made very nice pictures. Sure you probably wont want to crop it or blow the picture out super big but for a small print, it looks very nice. When you stop it down to 2.8, oh boy the pictures are amazing. At 5.6, it's razor sharp. A+ lens. The one I got didnt have any focus problems. It was perfect. Recommended :)
5
Used on my 7d crop CMOS sensor DSLR mainly for filming or epic product shots and to be used as my 50mm equivalent. Pros: 1.tough built 2.super shallow depth of field 3.lets in a lot of light Cons: 1.a little bit slow on autofocus mainly because of the heavy glass but it's passable 2.super exposed when filming with f1.4 outdoors with sunlight out even with iso at 100 so be sure to lower the shutter.
4
This is an excellent lens with very sharp optics. Bokeh is matter of personal taste but, I have that I really like the bokeh from this lens. Besides the cons I've written, I like everything about this lens: Cons: can used only in cropped sensor camera. Min aperture is f16. Sometimes I want f22 It doesn't focus fast as some of my AF-S (pro level) lens Until Nikon comes out with fast WA, I guess I will be using this one for while.
5
Picked this up to use on my crop sensor 7D (equivalent to a 48mm). Optics are pretty sharp, build is sturdy, and focus is precise.  At 1.4, you're gong to have a hard time finding a lens at this price, in this focal length, that competes. Works great as an all around lens, particularly as a people lens, and I even fly mine on my Glidecam.  I've some decent glass, and this is still one of my faves.  Highly recommended.
5
What can i add that everyone hasn't already pointed out. Build is great, sharpness is great, at 1.4 its extremely fast. Its a must if your looking for a prime on a crop sensor that will shoot close to 50mm. I got mine from amazon and i don't have any focus issues. This lens produces great photos and is also a great lens to shoot video. If your seriously considering this lens. I would highly recommend it!
5
I like the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens, but I HATE that it's 50mm. Yeah it's 1/5th the price of this lens, but I absolutely hate having to back up so far to take shots. The crop factor of the 30mm isn't as bad. The f/1.4 definitely makes it a good shooter under low lighting. But a lot of the time the picture gets too fuzzy when the aperture is too high. But overall I really like the lens.
5
I purchased a Canon 50mm F1.4 only to find out that it had to much zoom on my 7D. this lens is extremely close to the 35mm equivalent of 50mm. My copy had NO focusing problems at all. image quality is very good, although I still need more time to really comment on that. all in all, a great lens at a very decent price.
4
Nice lens, I bought it for my camera Canon Rebel T1i. The lens has some difficulty to focus in low light conditions (as stated in previous reviews), but it does focus. As for the sharpness I have to agree that it's not the best at f/1.4 but it is good as you reduce the aperture. I think it's a good price/quality lens.
5
I love this lens. I use it all the time for pro and semi pro shoots in my recording studio. the low depth of field is what makes it so great. the only thing I don't like is the lack of a MF switch on it so you have to control it from the camera but for the price that doesn't take a star away at all.
5
I would definitely recommend this lens to anyone who is interested. After much research, I bought this to cover a family wedding and was very pleased with the results. Its performance under low light conditions was the most impressive. Very sharp images and the "bokeh" effect is a killer.
3
I was torn between this lens and the 28mm 1.8 USM. I liked that this one goes down to f1.4 and I shoot a lot of live shows so that could be helpful. I've heard and seen the reviews saying their sigma front or back focuses but took the risk anyway. I got lucky; mine front focuses as well. Having a few photoshoots scheduled and only one body, I don't have time to send the lens + body in to get calibrated together. I guess the lens has to go back. I will try the canon 28mm 1.8 instead. This lens also does not fit on your body as easily as a canon lens, it's very snug when putting it on. Manual focusing the lens, it is very sharp at all apertures, softer at 1.4 as expected but very usable WHEN FOCUSED CORRECTLY. The chromatic aberrations, however, are terrible at open apertures, but drop to a reasonable level around f3.5. Honestly I'd be happy with this lens if it focused on what I wanted it to, but unfortunately I don't have time to ship my camera off to sigma. I know you don't HAVE to ship your camera with the lens for calibration, but I assure you that if you want it done right the first time, that's the only way to go. Also, in 'live mode' focusing while using the lcd screen (which uses a different AF system), it nails perfect focus even at f1.4 despite being mis-calibrated with the camera's viewfinder focus points.
5
This lens is perfect on my 7D for taking pictures in low light conditions. I love that I can take pictures on medium ISO settings in dark bars, venues, etc., without using an annoying flash. I have found the lens relatively easy to use, and gotten plenty of sharp pictures out of it.
5
When I originally purchased this item, Nikon did not offer a similar lens. Even after over four years, this is still my go-to lens for general use. One thing to keep in mind is that this lens is fairly hefty for a 30mm; my 50mm Nikkor is significantly lighter.
5
I bought this lens for my D60. It works really well and I have no focus problem as described be others. The HSM is fast and quiet. The color is a bit cold but still nice. Highly recommended.
4
I know I will get a ver soft focus at f1.4 but it seems like it is softer at f2 then my Canon 50mm @ f1.8.  Still a great lens.  Love that I can get the low light shots without the flash.  I just have to focus more on what the camera is focusing on..
5
Fast Glass! I love it and this lens performs flawlessly. I purchased it used and for the money, this is one of the best in my large camera bag. I thought it would be useful for concerts and portraits, but I find I use it everywhere. Great lens!
2
I tested it and it was front focussing quite badly. I don't have the nerve to send camera and lens to Sigma for calibration, so back to Amazon it went. I'll stay with Canon lenses.
3
I bought this because a friend recommended it. I tried it and liked the photo quality, but I couldn't stand the speed of it. It's autofocus was too slow to keep. So I returned it.
1
I used some Sigma lenses on Nikon DSLR for few years. It produce very good images with a reasonable price. I love it. The lenses haven't got any problem... I just recently got the new Canon DSLR(T2i/550D). Because I had good experience with Sigma, I'm confident to purchased two Sigma lenses, which are 30mm F/1.4 and 50mm F/1.4. However, "both" of them have serious front focus problem... I tested almost a thousand shots. Literally, anything I aim for are blurry. Therefore, I need to send it to Sigma and see if they can calibrate them... Since both lenses have front focus problem, I ifwonder it's incompatible with newer Canon dSLR systems. Beware when you purchase it. Maybe I should have get Canon branded lenses instead...
5
Good lens. I use it for video and i can get a little of the miniature effect what with the wide aperture. great for interviews. Nice build quality. Hefty too.
5
This lens is great for traveling; it's the APS-C equivalent of a 50mm prime, and is super-fast at f1.4.  You can basically shoot anywhere without flash- cathedrals, monuments, etc... and get terrific pictures.
5
This was my first lens purchase after digging into photography a bit more (e.g. moving beyond auto mode and using the creative modes). I have a Canon Rebel XSi and I simply wanted something that would give me better quality everyday photos of my 3 small children than what the kit lens produced. Since I was going to be taking a lot of shots indoors and at close range, the 30mm was a good fit. I rented a 50mm Canon lens when debating between the two and thought the 50 felt too tight in indoor spaces. I also wanted some great bokah for more professional looking shots and this lens provides that at the wider apertures. I am not a professional, just a mom wanting better pictures of my kids and I couldn't be happier with this lens. I shoot mostly in full manual, so I know a bit about photography (but not at a professional level), but the focus is great, it's incredibly fast, and the sharpness and bokah makes my photos look like they cost me a bunch of money. I bought this a year ago at a much higher price and don't regret that I paid a lot more for it than what it's listed at now. The memories I've captured with this lens are worth it. Really, $300 is a steal for a lens this great!
5
One of my favorite lenses. Sharp, solid, well built (even heavy!). For street photography the results are very good. Highly recommended, with a focal length equivalent to "the classic" 50mm in APS-C cameras.
4
This is a pretty good lens for the price with little aberration at the edges. The one problem is that there seem to be artifacts of point light sources if those sources are near the center of the picture.
1
BE ADVISED!!! do not confuse with EX DC "HSM"  and EX DC " " Amazon put picture of EX DC HSM for lower level EX DC that is cheapper!!  then after all,  it is not a bargain.
2
It's a superb lens if you get a good copy or get it calibrated by Sigma but if you are unlucky like many are with this lens, you will get soft photos due to the front focusing issue.
5
I was looking for a high speed lens to go with my 18-200 m/m zoom. This lens was chosen over the 1.4 Nikon. I think both will do a good job. But the Sigma 30 mm so far has been great.
5
The Sigma 30mm 1.4 is a good large aperture prime for crop models.  AF is fast and accurate in low light. image quality is very good, it's sharp in the center and in the corners
5
excellent lens. However, please bear in mind that this is not a "all-around" lens. It is a beautifuls, specialty lens for low light and stunning bokeh-portraits.
4
Despite the rumors of focusing problems, my lens came to my door in perfect condition. It focuses exactly where I want it to each time. When it comes to quality and getting the most bang for my bucks, this lens was the 100% right choice for me. I like portrait photography best, and street/macro come at a close second; the sigma 30mm 1.4 works well for all three of these categories and I'm sure it would work well for others too. It is especially amazing when used for portraits though: the contrast is perfect, it's almost never too dark, and the bokeh is nice and smooth. Pros: EXTREMELY sharp Focuses right where you want it to Bokeh is lovely Super sharp, especially when > 1.8 Useful for different purposes (portrait, street, etc) Around 50mm for 1.6x crop cameras Very minimal chromatic abberation Cons: Slow focusing in live view Slight grain Hard to put the lens cap on
5
My son was begging for this lens, but it was too costly in stores and hard to find. He found it online and it's exactly what he wanted. great price and better quality
5
This lens was an investment and I'm glad I got it! Its a very heave glass and metal lens that takes phenomenal pictures. Definitely happy with this purchase!
5
This lens is by far my best lens yet! Not to mention that it was really inexpensive compared to store prices. Definitely a must have in your lens collection!
5
i have a canon 450d and fit perfect. love at first shot.  i full recomend this len for potraits  front concert shows. so sharp and love the bokeh  amazing!
5
Very happy with purchase. Surprised with quality of Sigma lenses. I've had a zoom sigma as well. The primes are better. One of my favorite lenses now.
4
Well built. pretty darn sharp (except when wide open). The perfect focal length on an APS-C sensor to equal the traditional "normal" lens.
3
This lens is a funny mix - wonderful centre performance and awful edges. OOF areas look terrible if the backround is busy; smeared not blurred and with obvious CAs, although the latter is typical of f1.4 glass. My Nikon AF-S 12-24 is MUCH better but it is limited to f4. Even my 18-200mm gives a more even resolution across the frame at 18mm and f3.5. So I use this lens knowing I will probably need to crop images by up to 70% of the original to get a  good result. I don't have any focus or exposures issues on my D40X. As soon as Nikon get their act together with AF-S primes, such as an AF-S 28mm F1.4, I'll be selling this on Ebay for a fraction of what I paid for it. In the meantime, it does the job.
5
I love it! Great price compared to Canon's 35mm f/1.4. The only bad thing is that it's focus isn't as fast! Worth it either way!
5
Fast in auto focusing. Result are tremendous. Although when light power is law, it perfectly handles. Let lens do the work...
5
Clarity is awesome!  Definitely worth the money :)  Easy to use, and my 'go to' lens.  Not sure why I didn't buy it sooner.
5
Good in all senses. I love my new lens and I using it a lots. I rally recommended for the all; professionals and beginners.
5
I have a Canon 40D and take lots of indoor sports shots. My 50mm 1.8 Canon (the inexpensive $120 lens) is great but I needed a prime lens that could capture more of the action and was still somewhat affordable. I was trying to decide between the Canon 1.8 28mm and this Sigma 1.4 30mm and am really happy that I chose this. Turns out that extra f-stop (or 2?... I'm still learning all the lingo) is totally what I need. I was worried about the focusing issues that people mention but seemed to get a good lens and also took people's suggestions to use 1.8 to get that "sweet spot". The images are really creamy and rich and would def recommend this.
5
Great lens, gives me more opportunities to work with light on my terms.  Product arrived without delay.  Great service!
5
If you need an indoor lens for your d40, d40x or d60 (a lens with a build-in motor: AF-S or HSM) this is the lens for you.  30mm is the perfect focal length, 1.4 is the perfect aperture for indoor, low light use. A bit less details on the edges at large apertures, but personally i don't mind in those dark circumstances: other lenses wouldn't even be able to shoot anything acceptable at all.
5
I wanted to replace the 50mm 1.8 and definitely this is the one to go, a little heavy, but amazing anyways.
5
So far the lens exceeds my reduced expectations after reading as many user reviews as I could find.  I have not noticed any focus issues under any conditions so far using it on a d40.  The pictures are sharp and the lens gives the 'normal' perspective that I was missing with my Nikon 50 1.8.  The biggest downside is the lens is much much larger and heavier than I expected.  The d40 with the Sigma 30 is heavier than a d70 with the Nikon 50mm...  Bonus exercise I guess.
2
It has a hard time focusing when the aperture is wide open. Otherwise, a good lens.
5
This lens is great! It came exactly as it was described and arrived very quickly!
3
Was great while it worked... the autofocus motor died after maybe a year or two.
1
Focus was absolutely horrible.  Had to return.  Didn't bother with exchange.
5
Love these 30mm 1.4 lens there very nice and take great videos and photos.
2
The Sigma 30mm is a solid lens, and feels like a professional Nikkor lenses in its build quality. It is heavy, has a metal mount and plasticized metallic exterior. However that is where the comparisons to a high quality, professional lens end. This lens underperforms in several regards. First, it has the at this point well documented focusing issue. In addition, it constantly overexposes pictures on my D80. I am not the only one to experience this problem. (Google Ken Rockwell's review). It is fast, and it CAN produce a great image, but getting there requires me to use manual focus, and set my D80 to a -.7 exposure adjustment. For a so-called professional lens, this is simply not acceptable. I now use this lens only when I have to: when I can't use a tripod in dim interiors, or at dusk & when I don't need auto focus. I would not recommend this lens to anyone unless you really have to have the speed and don't care about the focus and overexposure problems. Honestly, I am surprised there are so many glowing reviews of this lens.
5
I have only used the lense for a couple of days but so far it is great.  Pics are very sharp with a very shallow depth of field.  The auto focus is a little louder than I expected but it's ok.
5
Of al the lenses I have (al most al Pentax) this is the one I keep the most on my Pentac K20D Camera. It's well built and reproduce great images. I am amuse with the performance of this lenses especially on low light conditions! let me show you a pic with it.
2
I bought this lens because of all the glowing reviews on here, so I was excited to try this thing out on my D300. At first glance and while viewing the images in camera, they look fantastic, but only after they're uploaded to the computer is when you can find the flaws of this lens. Viewed at 100% it's clearly noticeable that the sharpness consistency of this lens is mediocre at best. As noted many times before here, there's a serious front focus problem and only about 50% of the images I shot were in focus and sharp while in autofocus. As a professional shooter I can't afford to have only half of my images to be in focus, so after trying it out a couple times I had to return it to Amazon. It's unfortunate that the only Nikon equivalent to this lens (the legendary 28mm f/1.4) ebays for over $4000 sometimes, so I really wanted to like the Sigma, but I have since bought the Nikon 35mm f/2  as the replacement and it's as sharp and reliable as a Nikon lens should be. Even though it's not as fast and wide as the Sigma it's still a better made lens and can be used with more assurance of consistent results.
5
I bought this lens about a week ago for my Nikon D40x, and I must say that I love it! I have had no problems with the auto focus, and all my pictures have turned out beautifully! I definitely reccomend this lens!
2
I got this lens for my crop sensor Canon bodies (7D & Rebel).  I absolutely love the Sigma 50mm/1.4 and the 10-20/3.5 which have become staples in the work that I do.  Unfortunately, no matter how much I test and adjust this lens for the front/back focus on the 7D I still get inconsistent results.  No I am not talking about razor thin F/1.4 shots or hand-held shots at less than 1/30th or low contrast subjects in low light...I am talking on a tripod at f/8.0 on a high contrast subject and the image is just NOT SHARP!  This is most frustrating when you are out in the field and everything may look okay on the back of the camera body when "chimping" but get back home and view on the computer and POW !!  TOTALY SOFT IMAGES.  Not sharp anywhere, center, edges you name it...just not sharp and completely unusable. Some shots (I am guessing 1 out of 5) are well rendered so I'm guessing there is a problem inside the lens or the way the body interacts with the lens.  Not sure, because I am not technically savvy enough to know how this lens and body system work to achieve critical focus. Also note that I simply cannot use this lens on the EOS Rebel as there is no micro focus adjustment on these bodies...making the lens only 20% usable on the 7D only. Perhaps I got a bad copy (as many others have indicated here).  Thinking of sending it back to Sigma for calibration, but I've heard horror stories about that process so I may just unload it on e-bay or something.  If Sigma had a better reputation for customer service and/or quality control on this lens it would be worth the price.  Too many bad copies exist for me to recommend this lens.  Look at the Canon lenses instead.
4
I'm not sure if my copy of the Sigma 30mm f1.4 DC HSM lens had the "front-focus" problem that one reads about all over the web, but I did find that about 10% of the shots I took with it were insufficiently focused.  (I ended up returning it to Amazon for a full refund.  Kudos Amazon!). My shots were taken in low light (e.g. inside a church for a choral concert), but that's a major reason one buys an f1.4 lens in the first place.  All shots were with my Nikon D40, which may not have the world's greatest A/F system. I really liked the look and build quality of the lens.  I also appreciated that it came with a hood and case.  I just felt the 10% misfocus rate was too high. Also, I wasn't that thrilled with the effective 45mm focal length.  I may want something a little longer.  I would give Sigma products another try in the future.
5
The Sigma 30 1.4 is a great lens. It is sharp wide open and AF is fast and quiet. This lens paired up with my 7D is a hell of a match. The only thing I wish it had was IS.
5
i rarely write reviews, but i wish i did more. i had two of these lenses over 4 years (first one was stolen), and i will immediately buy another if i ever lose it. i never had a problem with it. in total i have 6 lenses and this one is the most used one. unless i need a zoom lens, i leave this on all the time, and it guarantees that i have better, interesting and more well composed shots than with any of my other lenses it outperformed many of Nikon's primes in resolution and despite it doesn't have typical Nikon's lenses color rendering (which i adore), this Sigma has its own, which is simply fantastic. i love the saturation, detail, bokeh (yes!) and in- and out-of focus transitions this lens gives to my pictures and also... it's 1.4!! i shoot a lot of low light situation, etc. and this lens is perfect. i can't wait to get a D7000 to put this on for quite a dream street shooting combo the only "con" is that a little bulk and weight.. but, it balances nicely, and raises a lot of envious looks from folks who have to use flash in situations when i don't
5
One of my favorite lenses!
3
It is a good lens for interviews or low light events but for any action or moving persons it just does not do the trick
2
I wish this len would learn from Mr. Miyagi, "FOCUS." At close range, about a foot, it works great. But when you step back from that distance and take a picture of your object of interest, ITS NOT IN FOCUS. I've tried different f-stops and shutter speeds, and still it is not truly in focus.  My purpose for this lens was to get more wide angle then my NIKON 50mm 1.8f on my D5200. If you are planning to use this as your go-to lens, overall you will be disappointed.
5
Works as advertised.
3
Update:  I received another lens & this one is good.  I have it combined with my E-3.  It still does not focus properly on my E-500.  Don't know why but it is great on the E-3 & I'm glad I got the exchange.  We have so few wide primes to choose from. I happened to get a bad copy of this lens.  It front focused very badly.  I am sending it back to Amazon for a full refund after going around with the customer service rep, he finally did the right thing even though it is past the 60 day return because I really want an exchange. I hope to order another & get a good copy.  The few times I got spot on focus by luck, it was very crisp.  Hope to get a good copy next time.  The focal length is great for indoors.
2
I got this for shooting semi-adequately lighted stage shows.  The first night I received it I shot mostly at f1.4 and 2.0.  I filled two CF cards and couldn't wait to get home to check the results.  Nearly 80% were out of focus!  Every one that was off was focused at a point about 5 feet upstage.  I thought about keeping it as a manual lens because I really liked the brightness but I couldn't justify the cost so I took advantage of Amazon's return policy (Thanks Amazon!)  Maybe I just got a bad one but it spooked me.  Looking seriously at a Tokina now.
5
Excellent LENS

This lens is spectacular, and a really handy focal length on digital cameras with APS-C sized sensors. I suppose people complaining about focusing problems just don't realize how shallow the DOF is. Awesome lens. Recommended as a fast, "normal" prime.

Perfect combination w/ my Nikon D40X camera. I used to switch between 15-70mm Nikon bundle lens and 70-200mm lens and now I only use this Sigma. I have used it just about 2 years and every time I take picture, it delivers very sharp picture. (Even at low light when compared to my two other lenses). One thing to keep in mind though, when you trying to use on outdoor, you need special filter. Otherwise, outcome maybe too bright you can't see the object as you expected. I highly recommend this lens!

It's nicely built, very fast thanks to it's F/1.4 and has very smooth and quite autofocus. As most of reviews noted, it is very soft in the corners when stopped down but with this kind of lens, you don't really care for the edges, especially as you get a wider angle than most of it's competitors in the category. I am very pleased with it, but if you are looking for a good portrait lens i would recommend the CANON 50mm F/1.4 instead. it will be much sharper at corners and will cost less.

Great lens.

Just got my copy of this lens which exibits the much discussed focussing problems... Sorry Jim, this is most definitely not a user issue - >This seems to be a user problem in my opinion. When you shoot >at f 1.4, the area in focus can be pretty shallow. An example >is at f1.4 and at a distance of 5 feet, the areas in focus is >just .45 feet. If you have a DSLR with multiple focus points, >you might find what you want in focus is not selected by the >camera. This gives the impression of a focus issue with the >lens which it is not. In single point autofocus the point of focus is a good 6 inches behind the subject at five feet distance (Nikon D50).  At five feet the depth of field with this lens at f1.4 is a couple of inches at most so very blurry images... Obviously manual focus is fine. I've sent it back and asked for another copy, if the next one has a problem I'll give up and get the Nikon 35mm F2, which would be a shame as i really like the look of the images made with this lens.  I'll update when I get the replacement... Mike.

I really wanted to like this lens; nice build quality and had a really good feel. I also liked the larger 62 mm Filter Thread compared to comparable lenses. However, mounting the lens already felt somewhat odd. It did not want to go on a 7D body as easily and smooth as my Canon or Tamron lenses. Taking the 1st shots and looking at them at the camera's LCD already was a little disappointing - the pictures has an odd pale almost green look. After importing the photos into Lightroom we saw the stunningly poor quality. Not even close to an inexpensive 1.8 nifty fifty and even worse than my zoom lenses in that rage; unbelievably soft and out of focus. Next we did the common focus test (described in much detail here: [...]) and the results showed that the focus was off by 15mm with a 500mm focus distance. But even the areas that looked like were in focus, were totally soft all the way to f5.6. Don't know how Sigma can stay in business when delivering products like this 30mm. Take a look at one of the photos we took during the focus test - and to be fair to Sigma, this was the VERY best we could find. [...] This was my 1st Sigma experience and I'm really glad the Amazon has such a great return policy. This thing didn't stay even 12 hours at my house. Sorry Sigma - never again will I buy one of your products.

I am another one of the customers that is having trouble with this lens and the autofocus on a Digital Rebel XT.  It locks focus less than 50% of the time.  My other Canon lenses don't have this problem.

So I just got this lens to replace Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 (this lens is just fine, nothing special). The build quality is awesome, the EX finish is very nice (not the rubbery/glittery finish, but the smooth metal finish). I put it on my D7000, first thing I wanted to try is autofocus on live view (that's the main, if not the only, reason I got it). And there it was, autofocus is not working. I know how autofocus works on live view with D7000 (it continuosuly autofocus, even with my old trusty Nikkor 50mm f/1.4D). But not with this one. I pressed shutter half-way, the focus was thrown off. This is not right. On viewfinder, autofocus works perfectly. And you know that people rave about this lens in terms of image quality, sharpness, bokeh, and so on. But again, if autofocus doesn't work on live view, what's the point (at least for me)? I wanted to use this lens for shooting movie. Quickly search on the internet shows that others experience the same thing. I'm not sure if Sigma has a fix for it, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to send it back for a refund. This is really, REALLY too bad. I love everything else about it..

this lens cost me more than twice its price in local market because i had to pay very high shipping cost and then i had to pay someone to unblock it from custom service in half way to its destination also the custom cost and fees were high .. Now in review  i notice its not as fast as i hope and its bit overexpose the photos .. i also notice that in video mode loose the auto focus ability  just seems like stuck in close up limit. this comes to normal after unmount the lens and put it back . switching to viewfinder focus goes to normal ..;( this might be Nikon's 7000 issue but never happens to other nikon  lenses  i have ( a 18-105 and a 50mm 1.8)  i also notice that focus motor does a very strange clicking sound that mixes to the video. The plus of this lens is the ability to take pictures in low light  and the fact that it seems like a normal 50mm lens in a DX body (APS-C)
5
This is a very sharp lens and is perfect for low light photos as well as portraits.  I use this lens with my Nikon D300 and I am extremely pleased with the results. It is the best Sigma lens that I own.
5
I read so many reviews on this lens and checked out many blogs discussing the pros and cons of this lens. I was taken back by all the negative reviews due to Auto focus, corners being blurry and sharpness issues. I still decided to purchase this lens for canon t3i. It is now my default lens. I absolutely love it. Pics are tack sharp 1.8 aperture and above. At 1.4 it's not that it isn't sharp but it only focuses on a very small area. Very good bokeh!!! I did notice its lack to properly focus on what I want it to but it's something I can overlook as the pics just come out gorgeous!!! I highly recommend this lens it won't disappoint. I had canon 50mm 1.8 and I sold it. Sigma blows it out the water especially with the 1.4 option. Also the AF is so quiet it reminds me of my good o canon L series lens.

great

So someone had already tried it on their body and sent it back. Didn't really matter since it might be perfect on my camera, but nope. It had a severe backfocus issue with my body and since the principle camera I was going to use it on is a T4i, no MFA. So I sent it back too. Also, at f/1.4 it was unacceptable. Not until f/2.8 did it sharpen up, but I have a 17-50 f/2.8 sigma that is razor sharp at f/2.8, so the advantage of an f/1.4 lens was out the window... Oh well, you try what you can. Aside from shelling out a few g's for a Zeiss that IS sharp at 1.4 or the canon 24 f/1.4, not sure what else there is out there?
3
I bought and used the lens for a month after I bought it then I never touched it again. It gave excellent sharp, photos in low light conditions. I managed to take a sharp photo of a friend who was 50cm away from my laptop and with only my laptop as the sole source of light in the photo. The photo came out very sharp. With f/1.4 you can shoot in some pretty dimmed conditions, but I'm sure if Nikon had its own F/1.4 it'd have done a lot better than Sigma's. It's a shame there are no Nikkor standard lenses compatible with the DX cameras. It's good for Lowlight, but too expensive for an f/1.4 standard lens. It's too big and heavy. Get ready for all the walls on your edges will look like they're falling down. Barrel distortion is just too much! I'd say buy a real nikon lens. I'll never buy any sigmas again. The difference berween Nikkor lenses and Sigma is just overwhelming!
2
So I did my homework before purchasing the sigma 30mm 1.4.  Research showed that bad copies are frequent.  Hoping that I wouldn't get the bad copy I went ahead and purchased it because I wanted a prime that would be roughly 50mm on my Canon 7d's crop sensor. Boy did I make the wrong choice because I got a bad copy.  My kit lens is better/easier to focus.  The focus ring was stiff and had play.  Focusing with this lens is like painting with cerebral palsy. I am returning this lens and just purchased he Canon 35mm 1.4 L.  Its way more expensive but I know that I will never have an issue with this superior lens. If you do buy the sigma 30mm lens make sure you do autofocusing tests to see if you were one of the unlucky many to receive a defective lens.  If the focus ring feels wrong in your hands, its probably because its not a good lens.
5
i'm not sure if i got a good copy of this, it's my first time to use prime and a 3rd party lens, i just don't know if it's normal that the lens makes squeaking sounds when auto focusing. you can't be so sure on lenses autofocus accuracy but you can make small alterations on the focus. i haven't tested it on a real photo shoot but my first few shots were not that good because i'm used to cameras and lenses with anti-shake system, maybe after few weeks or a month i'll be able to get use to this lens. i'm thinking of bringing it to a service shop for re-chipping just to be sure that the autofocus will work properly.

Bought this lens for my XT/30D. I really wanted to like this lens, it's nicely built, and fast focuses. Close ups work fine, but for medium distance to infinity, AF is totally random. Save time and energy. Stay away, Canon's 35/2 is a better/cheaper pick.
1
Read about the "front focus" problem, but took a chance anyway. Did an experiment comparing this lens with Nikon 50mm f/1.8. Sigma focused in front of the object while the Nikon was right on! Sent the lens back using Amazon's very friendly return policy.
5
This lens is amazing. People that complain about this lens obviously dont have a clue what they are talking about. I've head the canon 50mm 1.8 and 1.4 and they were JUNK, piece of cheap plastic. This sigma is bulky, heavy-duty, nice glass built. AMAZING. I would buy again. Now I want more sigma lenses. Screw Canon plastic crap.
5
great buy great lens ,a must have for any Photo kit.......in my opinion this is better then a 1400.00 wide angel......

I have a good experience with Sigma lens: 10-20mm and 18-50/F2.8, but this lens did not impress me at all. May be it is not focusing correctly, the image was not sharp at all below f2.8, even at 2.8 was not good enough(3 stops down). CA is also prominent off the center. My nikkor 50mm/F1.8 (1/3 of the price) will beat it hands down in sharpness and CA at f1.8, even Sigma 18-50mm @F2.8 zoom lens will beat it. What is the point in this lens then? Just to say - you have a prime lens? For $26 more you can get outstanding Sigma 18-50/F2.8 that would outperform it  in every department. May be I just got a bad sample, but I decided to return it. If you are D40,D40x or 60 owner - there is no other choices currently. Lets hope Nikon will introduce AF-S, but the chances are not good.

Well, what a nice looking lens and convincing equivalent for a 50mm/1.4... ... except for one thing : it was impossible to get right focused images, so to speak of sharpness is quite useless. I did send my lens to Sigma for repair but they simply denied the fact there's any problem with it ! I had at this time a Canon EOS350D and an EOS450D and the problem was exactly the same with both cameras. In fact that lens simply focuses in front or behind the subject. I'm sure the optical quality is very good because by accident some pictures were rightly focused and they were really good. But about 90% of the pictures were simply totally unfocused. I was lucky the seller accepted to buy it back... with some discount :-(( . I did not take the risk to buy another one and chose instead a Canon 28mm 1,8 which finally suits me very well for a nice price. Except if maybe I was very unlucky I will recommend to stay away of that lens, if only because customers shall never accept to be treated as I was by Sigma.
5
This is a great lens for low-light photography and it is very sharp. Quick focusing and relatively quiet. I LOVE this lens!
5
This is an amazing lens BUT you need to understand, purchasing the lens absolutely requires you to pack your camera body and this lens and immediately send it to Sigma for auto focus calibration. This is not an option but is a requirement. Sigma's service is truly superb, you will have the lens and your camera back in a couple of days; you only pay for one way postage. If you do not feel comfortable sending your camera body to Sigma do not buy this product. I don't care how well you think it focuses, unless professionally calibrated WITH the camera body you will not see the true potential of this lens especially wide open.
1
I bought two sigma lenses and I loved them for about 6 months. Now both are broken and Sigma service sucks. Save yourself a headache and don't buy sigma.
2
I read many reviews warning about the infamous Sigma front focus issue, but the attractive 50mm equivalent F1.4 specs of this lens blinded me from those words of wisdom.  I had to buy this lens to confirm that those warnings are all true. Time travel back two weeks. I rented this lens along with a Canon 28mm F1.8 to experience them myself.  After using both lenses for 4 days, I noticed they both have focus issues, Sigma more so than Canon.  But I like the idea of a F1.4 lens so I ignored all the reviews about focus problems and paid attention only to the reviewers who got "good copies".  I hoped that I would also get a "good copy". I didn't. I took many pictures over the holidays using this lens and found a high percentage of unacceptable shots.  I would say about 30-40% were out of focus (OOF).  I use a Rebel XT with a tiny LCD screen so reviewing the picture sometimes doesn't tell me if it's in focus or not.  With a larger screen, I would be able to see the OOF issue more easily and delete those shots immediately, so I guess I could've improved the acceptance rate in that sense.  Some shots were just slightly OOF and sharpening it in software later made those pics acceptable. On the other hand, when this lens finds the right focus the picture was razor sharp.  This is the reason I give this lens 2 stars instead of just 1.  My mom complained about all the wrinkles you can clearly see on her face.  She preferred the OOF shots more. I used focus charts to confirm the front focus issue.  During these test shots I also noticed that the right side of the frame is more clear than the left.  I don't like that at all so I had to return the lens.
2
I bought this lens when I had a 400D (XTI) and it performed okay - some focusing issue but about 50+% success rate, but since XTI had a so-so AF, I did not research further.  I only used the lens on f1.4 - f2.8 because I only use the lens mostly indoor and low light. I have another Image stabilized lens when I don't need such a fast speed. After I upgraded to 40D, the lens turned out to have Front focus issue. I sent it back to Sigma TWICE and after "Adjust to spec and tested", it came back with the same problem. The FF problem was so consistent (90% of the time) that I cannot use the lens unless it slow it down to f4.0, which defeats the purpose of getting this lens. Sigma insisted that the problem is with my camera body, which I used to test with 3 other canon lenses and did not find any problem. They suggested me to send in the body and adjust the lens to the body. Since it's holiday season, I cannot afford to be without camera for a few weeks.  :( Note: Sigma customer service was great though. They were very nice and helpful. So, this is a manufacturing issue.
5
I just purchased the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 to use on my Canon 20D and XT 350. I shot several low light close ups and found it is spot on for focus.
2
Howdy folks! I was searching for a fast lens on the (sort of) cheap and settled for this here Sigma. For a long time we were the closest of pals. Awesome focal length, and 1.4 aperture meant I was shootin' up a storm in some serious low light conditions. This happy marriage between my sigma and I went on for several years. Until one day I picked it up and a large portion of the lens just fell out.....Doh.......It was the very center piece on the back of the lens. I took it to a local photography store and it turns out I could just screw it back  with my hand! Wha???? So now if i take a photo is looks like it was taken through a 3-inch piece of plastic. No me gusta. My old partner is now a 450 dollar paperweight. Not sure how I feel about Sigma lenses anymore.

I've gone through three copies of this lens for my Canon 7D body. They were all defective on arrival. The first one had a very nasty grinding when turning the focus ring. Not only was it audible, but also it vibrated the camera somewhat. It was occurred more frequently when pointed down. I didn't bother testing it any further. The second and third copies shared the grinding problem to a lesser degree, but also was front-focusing by about 4mm. Other than these very apparent issues, the lens itself delivers very creamy bokeh and it is pretty sharp in the center when shot open. I just wish it worked as a $500 lens should work. These are just the risks you have to take when buying a third party lens.
5
This lens has its issues but they can be worked around. Light meter reads wrong. Focus on D200 if not correct if set to anything to center. Image quality is great. HSM is a bit louder than I would have thought. All in all I am happy with the lens for my uses.
5
Got this lens today and got it to tests and to work 20 minutes later. It's easily wins over Canon 50mm 1.4 if you play your ISO right and know how to focus. Mono-tri-pods are recommended as always. I also recommend to use CLEAR digital filter with it. Good luck!
5
Estoy muy contento con el desempe?o de este lente, lo utilizo para video con la canon 60D y es perefecto para bajas condiciones de luz, lo recomiendo ampliamente
5
If you want a 50mm lens for a APC DSLR this is the lens for you.  It's sharp and creates great DOF.  Plus the build quaility is amazing.

I JUST got the lens. Literally 15 minutes ago. So this review will be based on the very first impression. I got it instead of Nikon 35 mm f/1.8. I have Nikon D5100. I read many reviews and thought this lens would be fab to have. So far the pros are: sturdy! Compare to Nikon 35mm this lens is a lot heavier, made out of metal and is overall more sturdy. Comes in a very nice case. Cons: it doesn't autofocus in live view. Surprise! That is really not good because I like the flip screen on my D5100 and I like various angles and live view really helps. With this lens I will have to look into the viewfinder. I photographed in a low light and it takes some time for the lens to autofocus. There is no rear cup (may be because of how the case is made or may be I just got a copy that did not have a rear cup?). I am yet to test it in a day light to decide if trading it from Nikon 35mm f1.8 was worth it. So far it is a 4 out of 5.
3
pros :  great solid, heavy build.   smooth and weighted focus ring.   f1.4 aperture and full time manual focusing.   30mm is wider than canons 50mm f1.4   8 aperture blades, good bokeh (blur background)   center sharpness at f1.4  is much better than canon f1.4   works well against direct and bright light, no flare or ghosting. cons:  corner to corner sharpness is a joke (even when F5.6-8)   massive chromatic aberration/color fringing.   terrible auto focusing, back focuses, not accurate.   weird size 62mm filter threads.   special EX speckled finish quickly come off   $400  and not even full frame capable.   noticeable vignetting at all apertures   noticeable distortion, not good for portraits
1
Not sure about this lens.  It was great while it was working.  No more than 1000 frames through it and two years later and my camera gave the "Lens not attached" signal today.  When I detached the lens, noticed that the lens inside wiggles a bit.  I guess you get what you paid for got me once again...
5
I bought this lens very long time ago. I love this lens ever. This is best ever I had. If you have canon camera, this will give you wings for your pictures that you take. I don't need any other things for portrait, even at the party. Even if it doesn't do zoom, I don't use zoom lens after I got this.
2
I returned it. Description was not clear that this is a cropped frame lens.

ever wonder why 63-point focus? or other mumbo-jumbo focus in the last 10-year or so? it's all about which solution you want the focusing automation to target. focusing is essentially the same: an algoritm to obtain maximum clarity, by microadjusting the lens assembly. You want spot? it will collect image data on the spot you choose; it's good there or around there (because nothing is perfect), but no guarantee anywhere else in your picture. And spot is spot, means how you gonna get the best refine in a dot-area? Spot can't work always, so I know as a user. You want center? there it is, a small area in the center, where the clarity is averaged over. Over what? Well, the center spots could be a field of view as deep as the length of an arm ( in sports), which definitely won't win at wide-open, which restricts the dof to the length of a finger... Still, center betters spot because is 5-spot, yet again,  a random spot data is enough to throw the clarity off. This is processing data, eliminating errors, a complex computation as accurate as weather prediction. Fact is, the clarity plane is there, in between the spots in the averaged area. Wide open(f/1.4), it really is paper-thick deep, so you might waste clarity on let's say the tip of the nose, or the ends of eyelashes but hey, would you be more happy to have wasted it on the dark of the eyes? No difference to me; wide-open means only fast-exposure in good light, or a kind of save the day, in night-time. You want deeper dof at wide open? step back, get distance from the subject; dof thickens, at the expense of sharpness. Hence, sweet spot. So you have to let go. Give camera a bit of room to play. Don't go to manual program, set aperture to f/1.4- therefore dof to zero, and cry front focus, because is not fair. Focusing is the newest most complex operation of your camera; don't defeat it with your experienced knowledge on previous cameras, won't do justice to anyone. I also enjoy doing pictures in manual mode. I know dof=0 at f/1.4, and don't expect fantastic results more than once in a while. And when they come, i see in amazement that dof still is zero, but the watery look through one lucky spot of clear makes the art in a photograph. Get used to it, you might enjoy it; or don't, and keep crying wolf.
1
It was always hard to get things in focus (but when you shoot f1.4 it's usually harder) still I felt the lens's focus system is not the best. Then after a while it just stopped responding well it only focuses well when I'm close to the subject and the background has a weird radial blur that didn't have before. Great lense, if it worked.
2
Is a nice lens for daytime landscape but has some major problems with lights / stars. The lens produces spike-like point of lights.
2
Photography is a serious hobby of mine, for more than 20 years. I own the lens for six months or so, and I am sorry to say  - don't like it. Perhaps I received a defective lens, but I keep getting poorly focused photos out of my Nikon D70 with this lens. I must say this was a big surprise for me, build and materials are high quality, it has a nice feeling all over, I owned another Sigma lens (which I really liked - see later) but these focus issues just made me leave the lens at home. I have a moderate collection of other Nikon compatible lenses, all but two are Nikon, the two others are Sigma lenses - this one and a 10-20mm DX zoom (which I love). I also have a Nikon 35mm f/2 lens, which I had for three years or so before I purchased the Sigma 30mm f/1.4, I thought the somewhat wider angle, significantly wider apperture, and HSM AF would be great - they look great on paper, but... Nowdays my main two everyday lenses are the 10-20mm Sigma, and the 35mm f/2 Nikon.
2
I had a high hope for this lens, but I took lots sample test shots on Nikon D5300, the photos are not sharp. Even the photos taken by my Casio ex-h20g are much better. My kit lens with Nikon D5300 is much better, the only good point is faster at low light. I regret for purchasing it.
5
Easily one of the best lenses you can buy for any camera size format. I cannot wait to put this lens to work. Why have I waited this long to get my hands on this!!!!! Buy it.
5
how do i send back i have a warranty for this lens ?  its the perfect lens for me !
2
An easy way to check how this lens work in the field is to browse through the pBase camera database.  I was disapointed on the lens I received, and only comforted by those pictures at pBase that I didn't receive a particular lemon. I am feeling my D70 have difficulty focusing with this lens sometimes, can't really tell who's fault though. As to the warranty issue, FWIW a vendor I talked to also have the 1 year warranty, and he said the extended warranty was $10 more.

I received a bad copy from adorama.com today. I was really disappointed because I had great expectations from adorama.com..I'm sending it back today.

Attach it to your camera, and I can assure you, you will take pictures with it. I'm not exactly sure what else to say. Buy it if you want it.

The picture angle of this lens on a digital camera with an APS-C sized sensor (most Canon and all Nikon DSLRs) is 45 degrees, which compares to the 44 degrees of the Nikon 35mm lens. It is more expensive than the Nikon 35mm f1.8 lens but also produces higher image quality in what is still a very compact lens. Its picture angle on a digital SLR is that of a normal lens, and makes a good replacement for a 50mm f1.4 lens. It is not by any means a wide angle lens, which is unfortunate considering the cost of a used Nikon 28mm f1.4 lens, or the $2400 price for the Nikon 24mm f1.4 prime lens (which is a 36mm on a DX camera anyway). The Sigma 30mm f1.4 is sharper than my Nikon 50mm 1.4 lens and as sharp as my Nikon 85mm f1.4 lens and faster to autofocus than either of these two Nikon lenses. Image quality is excellent for digital use, with fringing and chromatic aberration very well controlled. If I had only one lens to use with a DX camera it would be this Sigma lens. The lens is an excellent compliment to a slow kit or other zoom lens, in particular for shooting indoors where the 35mm provides a wide enough perspective or field of view for most group photos and its f1.4 aperture makes it possible to use much faster shutter speeds and get sharper images with hand held shots or shots with people in motion (children) where subject motion blurring is likely. The VR of the zoom and a few prime lenses is of no use if your subject is moving around which is where fast zooms or the less expensive fast prime lenses are invaluable. If I am shooting at 1/80th almost all of my shots will be sharp regardless of whether someone is moving while at 1/40th the percentage falls dramatically - and this is easy for anyone to verify for themselves with their own camera.
