Oh, how happy I was when I found this product a few years ago.  Pricey, perhaps, but SO worth it.  High SPF, non-greasy, UVA and UVB blocking, what wasn't there to love?  My entire family of fair redheads depended on it for year-round protection. This year, though, things were different.  I eagerly stocked up on eight bottles of the SPF 45 before the start of the sunny season -- in previous years we used SPF 85 or 100 but I had faith in the claims that anything over SPF 30 was of negligible benefit -- and slathered it on the first time I was in the sun for an extended period.  Even with wearing long sleeves and a wide-brimmed sun hat I ended up with what (I thought) was a painful burn all over my face and neck.  It took a couple of weeks to clear and often resembled a rash, with raised, red bumps that itched like nobody's business.  I didn't make the connection until the next time I used it and had the same result within hours.  I don't wear makeup and I don't use cleansers on my face; the only moisturizer I use is specifically for sensitive skin and I've been using for a long time with no issue. After doing some research I discovered that what I have is a photoallergic reaction to this sunblock, which means the sunblock itself doesn't cause a reaction, but once it comes into exposure with sunlight it does.  Which completely nullifies the point of sunblock in the first place.  I also read that Neutrogena had changed its formula and the older "blue label" bottles were different than the new "black label" ones - checking a leftover bottle from last year with the new ones from this year proved that the formula does appear significantly different, with this year's sunblock containing a number of new complicated chemical names I can't pronounce.  One or more of them no longer jives with my extremely sensitive skin. So now I've spent upwards of a month suffering from red, itchy, oozing, tight, dry, skin, which is now starting to peel and looks a fright.  I haven't wanted to leave my house and I can't even count the number of times I've been asked if I'm all right/too hot/contagious.  Horrifying.  I am so very disappointed that I can't even properly express it.  I guess it's back to the drawing board looking for a new sunblock that can protect myself and my family without giving us chemical burns. A real bummer.

I've used this strength and other SPFs from Neutrogena with great results.  As for another reviewer's caution, this is from the American Academy of Dermatology' web site: 1. What is oxybenzone and how is it used in sunscreen and personal care products? Oxybenzone (also known as benzophenone-3 or BP-3) is one of 16 sunscreen active ingredients (compounds that absorb, scatter, or reflect ultraviolet (UV) radiation) regulated as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1 Oxybenzone provides broad-spectrum protection from harmful UVA and UVB rays. It was approved by the FDA in 1978 and is one of the oldest active ingredients in use today. The FDA has approved the use of oxybenzone in sunscreen in concentrations of up to 6 percent, which is less than what is allowed in both Europe and Australia (10 percent).2 Oxybenzone also is used to protect cosmetics and other personal care products from deterioration by UV exposure. 2. I've heard oxybenzone called a hormone disruptor. What does this mean and are there any data to support this? Concerns have been raised that oxybenzone may be capable of altering/disrupting normal hormonal (endocrine) balance. Specifically, oxybenzone is suspected of having estrogenic activity, which is the ability to exhibit properties similar to the hormone estrogen. There have been some published observations using in vitro (test tube) cell lines, as well as studies in rats fed oxybenzone, and in fish, where oxybenzone was added to the water, which have indicated oxybenzone or its byproducts can demonstrate some estrogenic activity.4-9 However, the observed estrogenic effects of oxybenzone often are considerably weaker when compared to the estrogen (estradiol) used in these experiments. In some studies, a much higher concentration of oxybenzone (1,000 to 1 million times higher than that of estradiol) was needed to achieve a comparable result. Importantly, available literature does not support a link between oxybenzone use and estrogen or other hormonal alterations in humans to date.10-12 3. Are there any studies in humans that demonstrate hormone disruption or other potential to affect human health? Similar to many topically applied agents, oxybenzone has been shown to be absorbed by human skin10, and can be detected in the blood and urine of sunscreen users and the population at large.13-15 However, results from multiple studies do not support a link between oxybenzone and any short- or long-term health problems, or the increased risk of adverse health effects. Specifically, when oxybenzone was repeatedly applied to the skin of human volunteers, it has been determined that: No biologically significant alterations in reproductive hormones (testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or estradiol) have been detected;11 The concentrations of oxybenzone absorbed are not capable of disrupting normal thyroid hormone levels12, and; The concentration of oxybenzone penetrating the skin is too low to cause epidermal cell damage.10 It should be noted that oxybenzone has been used as sunscreen ingredient since 1978, and aside from allergic or irritant reactions, such as photocontact and contact dermatitis, there has not been any report of systemic side effects of oxybenzone use. Therefore, the proven benefits of sunscreen to prevent sunburn and reduce the risk of skin cancer outweigh any concerns of oxybenzone toxicity or health hazard. 4. What do the FDA or other agencies have to say about oxybenzone? The safety of oxybenzone was originally reviewed and approved by the FDA in 1978, and it is one of the oldest active ingredients in use today.17 Since then, there have been additional reviews of oxybenzone by other regulatory agencies and expert panels with similar conclusions regarding its safety for use in consumer products. For example, in 2001 and again in 2006, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Union (EU) developed an opinion paper based on a review of current scientific knowledge and stated "the organic UV filters used in cosmetic sunscreen products allowed in the EU market today have no estrogenic effects that could potentially affect human health."18 Also, the safety of oxybenzone for use in cosmetics and personal care products was also reviewed in 1983 and confirmed in 2002 by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) expert panel, which is an independent panel of scientific and medical experts who assess the safety of cosmetic ingredients in the United States.19-20 Read the AAD paper with references: oxybenzone_questions_aad

I have to wear sunscreen every day and this it by far the best that I have tried. The sunscreens that I have tried before leave either a white mask or a super greasy face. This product makes my skin look smooth and without grease! looove it!
5
Love this sunscreen.  I have purchased more expensive sunscreen, but it was really greasy.  No greasy mess here!  Does leave some white streaks, but if you rub it in it will go away. :)
5
This is my favorite non-beauty sunscreen. It's incredibly light and absorbs immediately; I find myself actually wanting/needing to use as much sunscreen as the doc recommends for your face. In your hand, it feels a lot like moisturizer - but a tad thicker. Once it's on your face, you can't tell the difference. There's no scent that I can perceive, which I like. The product goes quickly if you use it regularly (2-3 months per bottle), so you can't beat Amazon's twin pack.
5
Best sunscreen I have ever used, hand's down. The tubes are perfectly sized (3.0 ounces) with a strong cap that will ensure clean, safe travels. The sunscreen is SPF 45, and provides excellent coverage. The lotion goes on creamy and dries matte-- no greasy, oily residue. Fantastic deal, and it helps that Amazon offers this lotion as Subscribe & Save.

I bought this product after reading other reviews on Amazon. This is a great sunscreen for those of us who hate the greasy shininess after application. It worked really well when I was in the Caribbean and let me tell you: it is HOT and SUNNY down there! On touring/shopping days, I applied it only once and did not get burned even after being in and out of the sun for 8 hours. On swimming/beach days, reapplication is a must. Sunscreen just isn't waterproof, no matter what the bottles say! I rated this product a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because it did not spread very well. It's pretty thick and you really need to use A LOT of sunscreen to cover yourself. I felt even two 3oz bottles was cutting it close for having to apply sunscreen everyday (sometimes twice) for a 1 week vacation. Nonetheless, it's the best sunscreen I've ever used and I'll buy it again next season.
5
This is simply the best sunscreen. You can just slather it on and within minutes, your skin doesn't feel like you ever touched it with sunscreen. I keep trying other products but I always come back back to Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer sunscreen. You can't go back after using it. You feel like you're ready to be roasted with those other greasy sunscreens. Not with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer. This is like you have no sunscreen on. And, man, it works. I've got white freckled skin like the good Irish descendant I am. I NEVER get burned if I have this on. And I know you're supposed to apply and reapply all day. I never reapply (OK, maybe my nose and chest), and I've NEVER gotten burned with it on. It's so comfortable and ungreasy you forget about it, and good thing since it lasts on you so long.. Sand doesn't stick to it. You can wear makeup with it. You don't have a ghostly white about you as you do with so many zinc oxide-based sunscreens. I do tan some through it, but never burn. I've used it for years, but suddenly discovered the cheapest is on Amazon. So I'll stick with Amazon for  my Neotrogena Ultra Sheer.
5
This pack is a great deal. The product is good as described, non-greasy at all. I always looking for something light, because my skin is oily. And this really keeps me from getting red from the sun.
5
It's absolutely worth paying more than the store brand for this stuff. This is the only sunscreen that doesn't make my skin greasy. I even use it on my face with no problems at all.
5
I love this sunscreen.  I just had a skin cancer removed so I now use this ALL THE TIME.  Thought the price was good too, but then saw it at Costco for less.
5
An excellent product even if you're in a wet and hot weather, your skin looks great and dry. I use it in a variety of conditions and works perfect! Highly Recomended.
4
This lotion advertises itself as a 'dry' product. How lotion can dry on the skin in less than 10 seconds is a mystery  to me, yet it is dry. I work quickly with this product and would purchase it again, if only for my chest and upper arm areas.
1
Yesterday I decided to do the right thing and apply sunscreen prior to going out to work in the yard.  This morning I awoke to numerous zits on my face.  Clearly this product was the culprit.  I will not use it on my face again.
4
Smells nice but not overpowering, has high SPF and Neutrogena is a good brand. I use it whenever I plan to spend some longer time outside. The scent is nice but still can use a perfume. It goes on slightly white but becomes clear. Will definitely purchase again.
5
We went sailing for a week in the Caribbean, and our captain strongly recommended this product.  He said that it wouldn't get the boat greasy and wouldn't stain the upholstery.  It goes on smoothly and doesn't feel greasy.  It doesn't smell bad, like some sunblocks.  And it didn't seem to stain around the collar of shirts like some sunblock.
1
My skin is not even super sensitive but everytime I tried to use it, it broke me out.  Greasy.  Yuck
2
I don't get all the great reviews on this stuff. I bought the 2 pack 45spf. It's very thick, leaves a white film. Flakes off nasty if you rub it at all. Settles in neck creases. It's not as bad if you use moisturizer first to help it smooth in. And put a light amount on. But if you put alot on to get good coverage, yikes. But on dry skin you'll have a white film. Absorbs better into to hands and arms, just not face & neck. And it does burn a little. But so do alot of suncreens on face.
5
Used many sunscreens in the past. I like this product as its dry touch, not greasy like some other products. It also smells good.
5
I'm acne prone, and this is by far my favorite SPF lotion for my face. I also use it on my chest, which is prone to breakouts. I recommend it to anyone!
5
I have used Neutrogena Ultra sheer for a couple of years now and really like it. It is light and not greasy. Since it is a bit expensive, I use it on my face/neck only.  It does sometimes get white in the creases, but not if you rub it in well. Despite living in the hot sunny South, I have never burned---actually my face never gets any color at all.  Which is what I want since I do not want wrinkles and age spots. Good stuff!
5
I only try to buy on sale because it can often be pricey.  Watch because there are a couple different sellers on amazon and sometimes the single & other times this double pack is the best value.  However, the product itself is the least greasy of all the MANY brands I've tried over many years living in Florida.  I always use on my face & for the reviewer who said it burned their eyes, well, unfortunately, that is the ultimate challenge, but you just have to avoid getting it in your eyes to begin with.  Even my daily face cream burns my eyes when I unfortunately sometimes am in too much of a hurry and am not careful.
5
I live at elevation of almost 8000 feet and good sun protection is absolutely essential. This product is great for sensitive very pale skin as mine. It doesn't irritate, smells nice and keeps you protected for a long time. I would recommend it as the best sunscreen you can get.
5
I struggle to find a good sun screen that I can put on my face with out being totally greasy and runs into eyes.  This one fits the bill, still protects, and doesn't seem to clog the pores.  So far so good. Also, many sun screens burn and itch on my skin - this one doesn't.
5
I usually purchase this item in the grocery store, but was buying other items on Amazon anyway and got Free Super Saver Shipping as a result.  The price for this twinpack of sunscreen was fabulous as well.  This "dry touch" sunscreen had been recommended by our dermatologist since it not only provide UVA/UVB broad spectrum coverage, it also does not have a greasy feel and is not clogging to the pores so it can be used on the face without causing blemishes or other skin problems.  Love it!
5
I love this sunscreen!  It is not greasy and has very little odor in comparison to other brands.  I applied it once and was in the sun all day and had no sunburn.  Love it!
2
I relied on this product in the past years.But recently it seems they have changed the formulae and its definitely no more a dry touch as my skin feels greasy with a white film.Also I can see white creamy flakes coming out from my face if I start rubbing my face....Yuck...have to try other brands now.
1
This sunscreen is really dry and leaves white streaks on your skin. The worst problem is that it really STAINS your clothes, car seats, everything you touch... It ruined my black leather car seats and my clothes were covered with white stains. Terrible product. Will never buy this again.
4
Great Sunscreen for most activities and situations. If I spend an entire day outside (8am-5pm) with no shade, this protects me with a morning application and another at lunchtime. Feels great on the skin and face, no irritation. No smell either. The one issue I have with it is this: It leaves a blue tint on stuff you touch. Most noticeably on leather car seats, and even more noticeably if its black. I spent a day autocrossing using this sunscreen and my car (outside) and seats were covered in blueish smudges. It took a while to figure out but once I suspected the sunscreen, I tested it and sure enough, blue smudges wherever the skin touches the materials (and has a little time to dry on). Its (fairly) easy to clean off with water and a soft tower or a wash for the more sensitive paint. I also used leather cleaner to help with the seats since rinsing them wasn't very practical. Since the product caused no damage other than cosmeticly, I only took off one star because for most activities at the beach or pool or out in the yard playing with the kids or doing work, it wont be a problem. I will be looking for a different sunscreen for motor activities but will keep this for beach and outside use otherwise.
1
If I could give this product zero stars, I would. Advertised as a product for those with senstive skin, I thought I would give this a try. BAD DECISION. I applied this several times a day on a trip to Disney World. By day 3, I had developed an awful, itchy rash on both of my arms. I originally thought nothing of it and took a benadryl that evening. When I woke up the next morning, I reapplied this the product, stepped out into the sun and could not stop itching. This product is garbage. I immediately discontinued use and thoroughly washed my arms to rid my skin of the chemicals. After my trip when I returned home, I contacted Neutrogena. They eventually sent me a reimbursement for this product but that does not make any of the pain I endured any better. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Ever.
1
If you like looking like you are covered in white body makeup, use this stuff.  Remember how lifeguards used to have a pile of white paste on their noses that stayed there all day?  That's how this stuff works.  You put it on and it stays white.  I applied it (like many other brands in the past that worked fine) and assumed the white color would fade as it soaked in.  It didn't.  Over an hour later it was still showing in spots I hadn't rubbed really hard to get it to apply like it should.  After another hour, I went in the water, and as I got out I saw on my chest and stomach what looked like skim milk dribbling down!  The stuff was actually visibly washing off in the salt water.  Another hour later and I could still see white in the folds of my skin on my arm and elsewhere.  And this was after applying other brands.  I have 2 tubes I threw in the trash.

I spend a lot of time outdoors. I am a triathlete and boater. I have tried numerous types of sunscreen. There were many things that prompted me to purchase this sunscreen. First, is that this is a broad spectrum sunscreen (protects against both uva and uvb rays). Second, is the endorsement from dermatologist. Third, is the promise of a light, non greasy application. This sunscreen truly delivers on all fronts. While wearing this as directed on a cruise, I was never once burnt despite being out in the sun for hours. I was especially impressed that once I applied the sunscreen I could not tell I had it on. Most sunscreens leave a sticky, greasy feeling. This simply felt like a light moisturizer. It's a bit more expensive, but in my opinion, worth every penny.
3
I bought this to bring on a trip to Florida.  I used it on my kids, ages 12, 5 and 4.  It did not absorb in to their skin at all.  They walked around with white streaks all day.  It seemed to work as far as keeping them from getting burned, hence the 3 star rating.  Other than that I didn't like it at all.  I called customer service and they sent me some coupons for more Nuetrogena suncare products....not sure I will be using them though.
1
The Helloplex was recommended by my dermatologist as being a great sunscreen. WRONG! I have sensitive skin and after four hours of using this sunscreen my entire face got swollen, started itching and broke out. I looked like a monster, went and saw a allergy specialist that informed me the Helloplex is one of the worst products on the market. They get the zinc into the smallest particles they can that are then able to absorb under your skin into your pores and cells. I had to use a prescription hydrocortisone cream and another cream to calm my skin. After one week I am almost back to normal. My daughter that is ten also used it and had a reaction of a rash on her face. I will never use neutrogena again! Beware if you have sensitive skin!

I work as an airline pilot and have fair skin, which is a recipe for skin cancer disaster. UVA and UVB rays are orders of magnitude stronger at altitude and the windows in my aircraft do not fully block all UV rays. This is my sunscreen of choice when on the job. I put it on every morning I'll be flying. Pros: - It really does feel sheer. It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen - It doesn't feel oily at all. Some sunscreens (especially spray on) feel like a second skin. This is fine for the beach, but I have the rare profession where I need sunscreen and a tie at the same time. - The small tube size is perfect for travel Cons: - It still smells like sunscreen. I would prefer that it smelled more like a traditional moisturizer lotion. - Not waterproof. This is a day-to-day activity lotion. It's not for the beach. - Much more expensive than other sunscreens. But you get what you pay for!
1
This irritates my contacs like crazy if I get it anywhere near my eyes and it makes my face break out so I will have to discontinue use. I also did not like the way it made my face look really white - even over tanned skin. In the summer it looks weird because the rest of me is tan, but my face looks like I have some kind of weird white makeup on my face. Plus I think it's a little too pricey. Think I'll go back to NO-AD brand.
3
It always leaves white streaks and starts to flake. I walk around looking like a ghost and if I touch my face or start to sweat it streaks and flakes. It goes on smoothly, but once it dries it feels thick and chalky. And I don't put it on heavily. I'm sick of it so will be switching to No-ad after seeing the reviews in Consumer Reports. I'd give it less stars, but it does do a good job preventing sunburn.
5
The Neutrogena Sunblock delivers on all the promises. It doesn't leave behind the oily skin which is one of the prime reason I selected it.
5
I was thrilled to find this Neutrogena sunscreen twin pack at Amazon. I've used this specific sunscreen for over a year due to skin cancer and have been very happy with its protection. I put it on after a moisturizer and before makeup. It hasn't seemed to negatively impact my complexion. As with any sunscreen, it's important to reapply if you're out in the sun or in the water for a lengthy period of time.
3
I use lots of Neutrogena products including the exact same one in spf 30.  For some reason the 45 leaves white marks whereas the 30 doesn't. It also doesn't go on as smoothly as the 30.  I am disappointed since i now have 2 bottles to use up.  I will stick with the 30 or get the 55 in the small liquid bottle they sell.
5
My dermatologist suggested this product which I have been totally satisfied with. After experiencing several incidences of basal cell carcinoma I am now more diligent in applying sun screen. I'm not taking any more chances with my skin as I get older. I have re-ordered this product numerous times over the years to provide protection from the sun's harmful rays.
5
Ok, i liked
5
My favorite sunscreen.  I have used this product for several years, because I like the very subtle scent and non-sticky feel.  Of course, the very effective sun protection is the best feature.  Provides sun protection for hours.

4 mum She love it

I like this product, its not as heavy as some of the others and I like that.

I was looking for a sunscreen that I could use on my face and wouldn't leave a white haze.  I stumbled across this and was pretty excited.  Welp, tried it one day and everything was great for about twenty minutes...until my eyes started to burn.  I hadn't been sweating; I was just lounging around inside my house.  I suffered with it the rest of the day thinking that MAYBE my eyes will get used to it.  They didn't. Then the next day, I went over to a friend's house and spent a few hours sitting out by their pool.  I used this sunscreen on my face again but kept it WAY far away from my eyes (stayed well above my eyebrows and left the area under my eyes completely uncovered).  If anything, it burned worse and again I wasn't sweating.  I ended up having to throw it away.  As far as I know, I don't have sensitive eyes.  Nothing else has ever bothered them.

perfect

excelent
1
I have awesome skin, I get complaints all the time. When I use this sunscreen on my face, I break out into huge monster sized painful zits. Since I bought this in bulk, I felt the need to use it anyway. After my mom started to insult me, I decided I needed to stop using it. My skin cleared up a week later. Instead of skin cancer I am not opting for break out free sunscreen.
5
I use this every time I go out, sunny or not.  Great UV protection and not greasy at all.  Highly recommended!
4
I use sunscreen often and I love an offer like this. I can't speak on the result of it actually protecting my skin, because i didnt notice anything noticeable (maybe yet) but it seems to work enough that I'm not burnt.
5
Sunscreen application is usually a battle with my 3 year old with sensitive skin. This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn't cause skin flare ups, tears and I don't have to make from scratch. Amazing!
5
Most sunscreen makes me sweat or feels greasy to me.  They also give off that sun screen aroma that makes people think I'm always the the beach.  It does have a hint of sunscreen smell but not too bad but it is not greasy or makes me sweat at all... Best one I have found so far.
5
Only sunscreen I will use as not oily and doesn't leave a residue.  Great Product that lasts a long time.
5
Its a great texture, leaves the skin feeling smooth and dry, not greasy at all! Second best only to home made sunblocks.
5
I took this pack to Cancun in earlier June, and it worked very well.  The area I applied this cream was not burned. And this volume 88g is perfect to take onto the plane.
2
do not buy this sun cream to protect your face! you will feel pain. Has lot of alcohol on it. I would only recommend only for body lotion.
5
Like that fact that it's not greasy feeling going on or afterwards. So far no issues. I'd buy this product again.
5
Product has always worked for myself and my wife. It is a ver We will continue to use ity good product
5
This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever come across. It is exactly what it promises to be. I love that it's non-greasy and it's wonderful as a makeup primer too! It also doesn't turn white...  No more second thoughts before putting on sunscreen. I love everything about it! I'll continue to purchase more and more and more till the sun is no more. Everyone should give this a try.
5
Being a recent melanoma survivor, I have been tasked with wearing sufficient SPF sunscreen and also must have UVA/UVB protection.  I have always appreciated the quality product that Neutrogena sells and I really like the sheerness of this lotion.  Goes on smooth, great protection from the damaging sun rays.  PLEASE wear sunscreen, because you are worth it!  :)
5
I wear this under makeup in California heat, it doesn't 'sweat' or become oily. I use it sparingly, I don't slap it on.  It's a really good product and tends to give a little glow to my regular makeup. Great price for a two pack, now I can finally keep one in my purse for touch-ups when driving in killer sun-glare.
5
I like this stuff and so does my dermatologist. It is not greasy and attract dirt and protects from sun well.
2
Goes on easy, it's light, and Neutrogena is one of my favorite brands of sunscreen, but it's WAY too flaky once its dried.
5
It is not greasy like the others and my dermatologist who is fantastic highly recommended these. Can't praise these enough.
5
I trust Neutrogena and I have used this Sheer cream before and it doesn't leave you with a white face. It worked for me in PNG no sign of sun on my arms and face.
5
I thought I would give this a shot and fell in love.  It's affordable and it goes on without grease.  I feel protected and that's what is important.  I use it daily on my arms and hands.
5
Do yourself a favor and get this sunscreen! I bought it to wear daily under my moisturizer. This double-pack was too good of a deal to pass up. It's by far the best facial sunscreen I've ever used. It isn't heavy or really even noticeable when I put it on, which is a must-have for me since my skin tends to be a bit oily. It also doesn't smell like a traditional sunscreen, which is good because I didn't want that noticeable sunscreen smell that so many have. It goes on really smoothly and absorbs fast.
4
Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45 Twin Pack 3.0 Ounce good quality and fair price. We are ready to enjoy a safe summer
5
I adore this lotion, because it dries quickly. Good to apply before make-up. It's a great value pack, make sure you buy this one or a higher protection!
5
I love this stuff!  The ultra sheer is easy to apply and doesn't feel or look greasy.  I fly gliders and we get a lot of sun exposure.  I need to feel confident that my skin is protected from all the harmful rays and sunburns just hurt! :)  Again, very happy with this sun cream.
5
My dermatologist recommended this product. It doesn't clog pores and feels dry to the touch after application. No sticky sunblock feeling.
4
This sunblock could make your face complexion seem whiter but once it soaks into your skin, it gives great coverage. I like the fact that it does not leave an oily finish on my face and hands. If you put too much, it doesn't distribute evenly on your face so you may get white streaks of sunblock. Make sure to evenly distribute around the face. :)
5
Although I try to be consistent in remembering to apply sunscreen, it usually happened that when I did, someone would inevitably say something about how they could *tell* I was wearing sunscreen.  Which is kind of discouraging.  After a fair bit of research, I decided to give this product a chance.  I'm really happy that I did!  This is by far the best sunscreen I've used - it's so light and absorbs very quickly.
4
The product is good, but it's just some more expensive than buying it, say, in Walgreens, as it might be cheaper
5
This product is non-greasy, long-lasting.  I don't usually like sun block but this product makes it easy.  I recently applied it on an all day rafting trip and did not have any evidence of burning when I returned at 6pm even after falling out of the raft a couple of times.
5
I will never use regular oily sun screen again! This product has been a real life saver. I used to look like a greased pig on vacation, not anymore thanks to this "dry touch"  lotion.
5
This is a great product used by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office Marine Unt and day shift Road Patrol.
5
I always trust in Neutrogena products, especially for the sun block lotion. It doesn't make me having a white face, but I apply it a little bit amount at time.  It protects my skin well.
5
I've been using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 30 for a long time, and love it. I ordered 45 because that's what was available. It feels more greasy which is a bummer, but I still prefer it over other brands. The bottles I received are as described and they arrived on time.
4
This product works as described but it does have the oxybenzone in it that is bad for mens health. Also it is way expensive.
5
I only buy this brand! Their sun lotions give me magnificent protection and long-lasting tan. They are also really easy to apply and smell nice without being too beachy/coconutty.  I use the SPF45 for the first 1-2 sun exposures and then switch to SPF30. I have relatively fair skin and it still protects me wonderfully!
5
We were very satisfied with this sunblock. Its goes on smooth and stays on long. It gives  you a perfect tan without getting burnt.
5
non -sticky, dries fast and lasts longer. Resistant to water as well. serves the purpose perfectly. would buy more definitely.

I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL YEAR ROUND AS A HYDRATING CREAM.  IT IS PERFECT FOR ME.  I CAM RECOMMEND IT, BUT ALL PEOPLE ARE NOT THE SAME!
2
I've tried using this sunscreen when doing yard work and other out door tasks, but every time I begin to sweat around my forehead, the sunscreen drips down into my eyes, causing a sharp burning sensation to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open. I would not recommend using this sunscreen when doing any type of physical activity or if you are doing something that may cause you to sweat.
5
This product is what you would expect. I would recommend it to a friend and I will buy it again if needed. I've put it on before going into water and it still worked!
5
I like it, less oil. It's very useful?I will buy it next time. I would recommend others to use it.
5
Neutrogena, for my tastes, makes the best feeling sunscreen. I just do not like the feeling of sunscreen on my skin, and as such, I dread putting on something that amounts to safety equipment. Neutrogena is the best of the bunch for me in terms of feel.
4
It doesn't make me breakout and it doesn't feel oily.  It actually feels like a power after you rub it in.
5
If you hate the feel of sunscreen and you have sensitive skin, this sunscreen is great.  It feels drier and not oily and it doesn't clog your pores.  My oldest child has eczema and this is perfect for him.
5
The product goes on nice and sheer. It soaks in and feels utterly weightless. It would work well under makeup.
5
A good buy because this is one of the best products around. Love my sunscreen from Trader Joes too. Can't get through summer without them!
2
I like the SPF level.  What I dislike is that after I apply it to myself and kids, there is a white film that gets on anything and everything that I touch or my kids.  As soon as I put it on my kids before school, they sit down on my black sofa and there is white smudges all over the seat of the couch.  There is sunscreen smudges on the black leather seats in my car, the inside of the car doors, on the OUTSIDE of my car on the paint.  It's really annoying.  It's a good price, the SPF is excellent, but it is too messy for my taste.  And it has tons of parabens in it.  :-(
5
I am hyper allergic to sun light ( medical term is polymorphic light eruption) and my dermatologist recommended this (spf 45 or up). What should I say more? ;)
5
Dont need to apply much and after a minute, you wouldnt even know you have it on, and it was very protective.  Love the small size as you can carry it with ease and reapply when ever you need to.  And you don't waste it as a tub is about the right size per person for a 6 days beach trip!
4
The spf is more then enough (30 spf blocks 97 percent of harmful rays and every extra 10spf only protects you from like another .5 percent) and I find it to be moisturizing even though it doesn't claim to do so. I also have oily skin and this stuff doesn't make it any worse for as long as I keep using my skin creams for oily skin regularly.
5
While they may seem small at first, they really last quite a long time. I was particularly pleasantly surprised by the non-greasy nature of the sunscreen; for while any sunscreen will make your hands/body a bit greasy, these were surprisingly good on this front. With a family history of Melanoma, I'll come back to this brand for that never-ending fight against the sun's rays.
2
I was so happy with another Neutrogena product spf15, that I didn't hesitate at all when decided to buy this one with higher spf. But after applying it I got really disappointed: it smells very unpleasant, like rubber or something. And if you don't spread it evenly - you will soon notice white stains on your face. However hard I tried to rub this sunscreen into my skin - I couldn't get rid of white stains.. The only good thing about this product is that it isn't greasy, though this makes it harder to rub in
4
I bought the twin pack because it had a value size to it as well as it's good to fit into our Harley bags for keeping it small and not taking up lots of space.
5
good coverage, minimal smell, no pasty-white skin after application.  I put this on my acne-prone skin and don't have any problems.
5
My mom uses this and always says how expensive they are. This was a great deal. Especially for two! Love it!
5
I buy this product for my husband who has a propensity for pre-cancerous lesions.  He has had 2 different dermatologists recommend this product.  It blends in well, non greasy and not too aromatic.  Great product!  Even with tax, it is less expensive through Amazon.
5
This stuff is amazing. Non-greasy, after a minute or two doesn't even feel like you've got sunscreen on. It is very lightweight but provides good coverage.
5
Does not have the cheap perfume smell which most manufacturers seem to think we need.  Also, it is easy to rub into the skin and does not show as a white mask on your face.  Those were the two things I wanted and they are not easy to find in the same product.  Way to go, Neutrogena.
5
It comes in 3 ounce bottles, which is only really a little bit of product, but it is well worth the money, because of the fact that it really isn't remotely greasy and only has the slightest, virtually undetectable sunscreen smell, and it does what it is supposed to. This is exactly what I was looking for because I have very fair skin, and I typically despise wearing sunscreen because of the smell, and the shine and how heavy it feels, but this sunscreen is wonderful!
5
I have been using this for years. And I have nothing bad to say. Doesn't melt, isn't greasy, protects your skin. What else could you possibly want?
5
i loved it, the price is great, i took my time to find other prices and by far this price is the best
5
I like this sunscreen a lot and it fits with the crazy 3 oz rule that the airport enforces. Doesn't seem to clog my pores, isn't overly greasy, and works great for me.
5
I have really sensitive skin.  It takes very little time in the sun for me to get sunburn. And I live in Latin America, which means we get sunny days most of the time.  Neutrogena ultra sheer will get the job done, and it doesn't feel (or look)greasy, so I can use it every day without my skin acting up, or looking like i just soaked my face with baby oil. Highly recomended, and remember:  a little goes a long way.
5
That is what I expected. Just in time I apreciatte too a very good price . I can recomend in the future
5
doesn't feel too heavy, i have sensitive skin and i wear this on my face and body.  Never had a burn with it
3
I have been using this product for about a year.  I'm not sure I will order again as it has an oily appearance even though it says it's not oily.
5
This is great sunscreen that doesn't leave greasy or sticky mess.  My wife love's it and prefers it over all other brands.
5
Having always used neutrogena products for my skin, this sun protecting lotion has a lightweight feel that does not leave my skin oily. It's fast absorbing and graet for everyday use underneath makeup.
5
It's truly effective -- both against UVA and UVB. (I'm have lupus and am extremely photosensitive and need a sunscreen that protects against UVA & UVB) It doesn't feel at all greasy -- a big bonus when using it on my hands. It's a good price from Amazon, especially compared to my local drugstores. I highly recommend Neugrogena Ultra Sheer -- it works and since it feels so nice and is so easy to use, I don't hate putting it on every day.
5
I absolutely love this sunblock! I buy it from Amazon every year to take to the beach with me. It is very lightweight and has a pleasant smell. And most importantly, it works very well. I can even use it on my face. Most other sunblocks break my face out, but this one! I highly recommend it!
4
It is good, but not perfect. It is not as light as the other I am used to and I have to spread it hard to not having my skin white. Also, if it gets in contact with the eyes, it burns. Since it does the job of protecting against the sun light and it is not greasy, I can give 4 stars. It is the best I can buy for this price.
5
This is great stuff. It goes on nice and sheer (requires some rubbing in) but doesn't feel heavy or greasy.
2
I saw this two pack for a bargain price at a local retail store.  I figured I would try it given the fact that I've had good luck with Neutrogena sunblocks in the past.  After using this for the past two days, I will not be applying it to my face ever again.  It has irritated the skin badly and my face now has a ruddy complexion.  It almost looks as though I've received a mild sunburn.  This product has noticeably dried my face.  I have not experienced pain nor discoloration on my arms or neck.  I do not recommend this for people with sensitive skin.  If you want a good daily sunblock, I recommend either the Neutrogena Ultimate Sport SPF 30 or Blue Lizard Sensitive (all natural).
5
Great product the leaves no residue. Living in a hot tropical environment where the sun is present all the time, I need good broad spectrum sun protection year around.  I go through a tube every 3 to 4 weeks so this twin pack is a good deal inmy opinion. I usually apply only on my body but have used it only face without any problem (face gets a different sun screen).  It goes on everyone in my family including the littlest person.
5
lo mejor, protege y mantiene el rostro hidratado y el acabado en sedoso y matte todo el dia, un HIT!
5
The user of this sunscreen is very particular on the specific sunscreen she uses.  This is the exact sunscreen she uses and the expiration code is 2014 which is also nice.  It would behoove vendors to note the expiration date to alleviate fear of getting expired product.  I would buy from this vendor again.
5
This is only the best sunblock ever! Not oily at all! And the same product could sell for twice the price at my local store. So worth buying!
4
I bought this sunscreen after trying multiple retail store options (coppertone, etc.).  I like this one because it's easy to pack/travel with (3.0oz), goes on easily, works well and is not very visible unless you're looking for it.  I took off one star because it does leave a bit of white-dust on your skin (yes, I know that's what makes it work! but still, I'm brown so it shows a bit more) and that gives it room for improvement.  Overall, I recommend this suncreen and the Amazon price is so much better than retail!
5
So happy to have found this product. It's great for having SPF without the grease, white residue and sunblock odor! This is a solid product + great price.
5
I like the smell and feel of this sunblock. It does not smell like "sunblock" or perfume. It is not greasy. I read some reviews and it was suggested that Neutrogena with helioplex is one of the better sunblocks.
5
I like the product - it goes on easily and has a spf 45 rating - Doesn't have offensive smell.  Good value.
2
Thought this would be matt and not greasy well it isn't. I am not impressed and plan to look for another protecion that is less greasy , more sheer and matte. Edit : now i stopped using it all together even when I need it cause it gave me pimples /acne .. you need to have a dry and not sensitive skin to use this and again this is not matte nor dry!! I am surprised Neutrogena would make such claims that are not at all true ! very disappointed .. the smell is divine though like sambac jasmine so my way out not to through it is use it as a hand and feet protection...also my daughter who doesn't have an acne prone skin adores the semll and uses it on her whole body before going swimming..
4
For years, I was happy with my Ocean Potion SPF 50 sunscreen (pink bottle), which I still use on my lower body sometimes because it works great, it's less expensive, and it smells wonderful (hint of orange). But I was looking for something that would be a little less sticky around my face, neck and chest, and friend of my turned me on to Neutrogena Ultrasheer Dry Touch. I love this stuff. It goes on easily, spreads well and within minutes is dry to the touch. Really. I use quite a bit of sunscreen (technically, you are supposed to slop it on, not use it sparingly), so I needed one that would not "ball up" even when I used a lot on my face. I've read a few complaints where people said it just smeared and balled up or gooped up on the skin (that's the extent of my technical terminology). That just means that one has used too much and it didn't absorb everything or that you put too many layers on (Avoid putting a thin layer on the then another one on top -- just do it all in one go, and you should be fine). For such a high SPF, this one smells pretty good, and the scent wears away quickly. The only negative is that it is fairly expensive. I pay it because I like it and think it's worth it. I haven't found one better.
5
To fully understand what my endorsement means, you need to have a little backstory. My mom DOUSED herself,  me and my sister in sunscreen throughout our childhoods, and she tried everything--Banana Boat, store brands, you name it, trying to protect our incredibly fair skin from the sun. When she got skin cancer when I was 18 I realized how important it was that I keep using sunscreen, but everything I tried was either ineffective or incredibly greasy and unpleasant. Believe me when I say I tried EVERYTHING--sprays, countless brands, sticks, creams, everything imaginable. I had finally settled on one I didn't particularly like when I went back to visit my mom and found this in her medicine cabinet. This stuff is gold. Not only does it COMPLETELY protect my skin, but it is not at all greasy and soaks in right away. Before, even with sunscreen, I would burn even if I just took a quick walk outside. Now I can go to the beach in direct sunlight for two or three hours and my skin not only doesn't burn but feels better and softer at the end of the day. Most sunscreens, after applying, I feel like I need to wash my hands right away--not with this! Usually with sunscreen I have to wait 10-20 minutes before putting clothes back on, and with this stuff I wait two minutes and I'm ready to go. Also, the "sunscreen smell" is not strong at all, and fades quickly. BUY THIS. Most people I know are skeptical about sunscreen simply because of the greasy feeling they have all day, and I always recommend they try this. I'm a devoted customer for life! (small side note--as with all sunscreen, be aware of the expiration date. people often forget about it and throw on some sunscreen they found in the back of their medicine cabinet from 1994, to disastrous results)
5
This is my first sunscreen lotion that I am using.  I liked this product.  This product makes my skin look smooth and without grease! . I love this product.
5
Neutrogena is an excellent company.  I used this sun lotion for my grandson who has very sensitive skin.  We were in Myrtle Beach SC for a whole week and nobody got sunburn.
5
I really dislike wearing sunscreen.  I don't like applying it; I don't like the smell and I hate the greasy feeling it leaves on my skin and hands.  This is by far the best sunscreen I have found!  The smell is okay, but more importantly, I can put it on and forget about it and not feel like I am covered in grease.  I even use it on my face when I have to and it feels okay.  It is a couple of dollars cheaper on amazon than at Target.  Highly recommended!
3
I used this product and I it worked well for me. My husband wouldn't use it because he said it was difficult to spread around the body. My 16 month old baby has eczema. This made her break out in the worse case of rash I have ever seen. So, I will keep using it, buy hubby something else and figure out another solution for the baby.
5
I have such sensitive skin so I always wear sunscreen and this one really prevents burns. I wear it every day outside etc. It is downright amazing.
5
I am very fair and wear sunscreen when I know I will be in the sun for a while. I have been looking for a sunscreen that is "invisible." I didn't want to smell like sunscreen or look greasy from it. This sunscreen does have an odor but not very much and is always clear. I never look shiny like you do sometimes with other sunscreens after you've been outside for a while and sweating. The only thing is that if you don't blend well enough you have to watch that it doesn't build up so that you can see the white lotion on your skin.
4
This sunscreen is effective.  I use it everyday, and never get burned.  The twin pack is a good value, too.
5
I actually bought this from wal-mart but it's good and non-greasy i recommend it to anyone i have sensitive skin and it work well with it you can barely tell it's there
5
Although my no. 1 sun block has SPF 110, i bought the 45 twin pack knowing the difference in number does not drastically reduce the effectiveness of the sun blocking. I have been using the Ultra Sheer for over a decade and have no breakout or complaint.  I just have to remember to re-apply timely, which i don't so as often as i should have....
5
I bought this sun block because my doctor told me to do that. And is really good for my face and I always use it, I like proteccion 70 when I go to the beach, and I use 45 every day to protect my face, neck and hands. I try to have always one in my bag.
3
This worked great on both of my daughters (1 and 3 with skin issues) but it broke me out big time!  I'll buy it again for my girls but I will keep looking for me.
5
Planned on vacationing in Australia during their Summer. I bought this to prevent sunburn. I'm happy to report it worked wonderfully! This is a great product, even better with in this cheaper packaging.
5
I needed a sunscreen that wasn't greasy and didn't shine excessively when applied. This sunscreen had it all. It is a moisturizer, sunscreen, waterproof and 45 spf. I couldn't ask for anything more. Little pricy though, but well worth it.
3
This sunblock is a little too greasy, or maybe just for me. I think not as dry-touch as the description. The scent is ok
4
I really like this stuff. It's not sticky and oily like other sun screens. The smell is a little much for me sometimes, but I get used to it pretty fast.
5
This is my favorite sunscreen, it is not slimy or greasy. It is easy to apply and works.  I actually will use this product.
5
Neutrogena is such a great product.  I use their skin care as well as makeup.  This sunscreen is great and I can reimbursed from my FSA too.  Win, win.  Protect your skin:)
5
I purchase this product for our Maintenace members to use while working outside.  Just imagine having a bunch of tough guys asking for and using a product.  They like the fact it does not show and does not leave them with an oily film and the key to protecting your skin is just that the willingness to use a product.
5
This works really good. Recently in Mexico and not one single burn. I came back as white as when I left! Hahaha. It goes on nice and isn't greasy feeling. NOT natural though so don't use if going in the ocean or any water where animals or plants would be adversly affected. Works good in water otherwise though.
4
Feels great - not greasy at all.  I reduced by one star because  if I use it at the end of my face (near hairline) or at the edges of my neck by the shoulders, I break out.  Therefore, I put in on the areas that tend to develop dark spots and then cover entire face and neck with my usual Oil of Olay factor 15.
4
Pretty low grease. Dry application. Good for the face, GREAT for sunny SoCal. Didn't clog my pores or make me break out. And I avoided sunburn through an entire drought-ridden summer in San Diego. There are dryer/healthier options but the price on these is really good for a decently high quality product.

Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Neutrogena and most sunscreens tested by Consumer Report are called **Chemical Sunscreens** not **Physical Sunscreens**. Consumer Report does their tests on Chemical formulas not Physical formulas since those are inexpensive products. I refer to Consumer Report when I am purchasing a table saw or a battery but never for anything related to my health since for that I refer to EWG. Zinc formula sunscreens will cost four times more, are not sold in big box stores but it is the same concept as consuming processed food with chemicals since those chemicals are absorbed by the skin where Physical Sunscreen formula stays outside the skin. Read Ingredients of anything that you apply to your skin just like you would be consuming inside the skin. Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical, blocks both UVA (320?400 nm) and UVB (280?320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health. SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer ? 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin?s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.

I'm a dark skinned fellow (Indian) and this product come up blue on my skin.  Even when I rub it in vigorously, you can still see it.  I'm an avid athlete, so when I start to sweat, powder shows up all over my skin.  I gave it to my girlfriend who is fair skinned, and she loves it.
5
This is a great deal and they work very well. I find if I set it with a powder after letting it sit on my skin for 10-20 minutes, it causes no difference to the performance of my face makeup. I haven't gotten burnt wearing it yet so five stars for doing what it's supposed to do
5
Best sunscreen ever. Goes on well, lasts and doesn't feel greasy. Remember, no matter your skin type, once you hit SPF45 there's really no significant protection increase over that. So use this and pretend you're a tough guy, rocking SPF45 with dreamy white Victorian era skin.
5
This is our family's favorite sunscreen! It protects well, only has a slight smell, dries fast, and isn't greasy at all (that's the best part). Being the bottles are quite small, and we fly through them - it was great to find them in multipacks at a good price here on Amazon.
3
I've been buying varying strengths of this product for many years and this year noticed that the new ??? formula burns my eyes like crazy.  I don't ever remember having that issue in the past.  Aside from that, it does on dry and has a nice / subtle scent, and really works.
5
We have many sunscreen bottles in our house - sport, baby, sensitive skin, spray. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer is my favorite out of all of them. I use it on my body and face. I applies easily and feels like regular lotion once rubbed in. I will always have this on hand.
4
I apply this after my moisturizer. I use Cerave, so I have to wait a few minutes to let it soak in, otherwise the Sunscreen feels heavy and greasy. It does leave my face a bit shiny, but a quick dusting of mineral powder takes care of that. Over-all great product.
5
This is my go-to sunscreen for wearing under my makeup.  Its not greasy and it soaks in quickly.  I can apply the sunscreen, and my the time I get to my foundation, the sunscreen is completely absorbed and doesn't hinder makeup application or final look.
5
The best sunscreen for outdoor activities...  hiking and backpacking... I hate greasy sunscreens or ones with heavy fragrance.  It'll get everywhere - on your clothes, sleeping bag, tent, hands, food...  this is the only brand and model I'll buy.
5
My wife and I have been using this product for years now ... I stopped using aftershave, and put this on instead.  Gives me a smooth skin as well as sun protection, all in one step.  We lived in San Francisco, so daily sun protection was a must.
2
I use it but I don't like it. It makes my skin turn bright red, which turns back to the normal color after a few minutes. I don't remember any other sunscreen causing this reaction before. Because of this, I will not repurchase this product.
5
I need all the protection I can get from the sun.  I wear a hat and use sunscreen and still manage to burn.  This year I purchased this product on a recommendation from my doctor.  Hopefully maybe a tan instead of blisters.
2
When I opened product, it was all separated and goopey.  I think it got too hot or too cold during shipping.  I went out and bought some at the grocery store.  Even though it's more expensive, at least it's useable.
4
Neutrogena stuff is my favorite. The sunscreen is great but I'll prefer to use a spray next time. The cream tends to be like a thick white layer. I still got sunburnt, but may be because I was at burning man ;)
3
I don't really like the smell... Also the cream is a little thick, and not compatible with other product like BB cream. The result for the aspect of anti-sunshine is fine, the prize is great too.
5
Neutregena's product is as it describes able to provide excellent sunscreen protection while you are sunbathing and swimming.  It's a nice soft cream that is dry and not greasy.  I enjoyed using it 'cause it's very light and not greasy.  Plus it's just very effective at what it does.  I did not get burned while using it on a recent trip to the Caribbean.
5
This is a favorite sunscreen.  It goes on and doesn't feel heavy and has good protection.  I kept missing the local sales, but Amazon had a decent price and it came to me at my home.  Highly recommend.
4
This is the product that has worked best for me over the years.  I made a stupid mistake and tried Livestrong which was twice as expensive and half as effective.  Happy to be back using this product.
5
I just keep buying this.  Feels the best on my face and head (I'm bald!) compared to everything else.  I hate how sunblock feels, but this is alright.  I put it on, I sweat a bunch, and I don't burn.
1
Used it on my face and experienced drying and mild irritation. Never had any allergy before. Usually use run of the mill banana boat. I'm not normally sensitive to skin products in general.
5
My dermatologist recommended this product. I love the clean feel it leaves on my skin. We got a great deal 2 for the price of 1 in drugstores.  We will be purchasing this thru Amazon again
2
...but it left a white reside where my arms brushed up against the front and sides of my shirt. I don't remember that being a problem with the last tube of this that I bought.
5
Non scent, non greasy and drys up very quickly.  Got tired of the scent on the banana boat sports brand and greasy oily too for my skin this works.  This coming from a dude.
5
The creme worked very well and i did not get burned but still got tanned. I liked it as it did not leave an oily skin after being applied.  Definitely recommended.
5
Always use this generously before going to stay outside for a long time. Actually happy with SPF 30. The 45 is fine. Reapply every two hours so prevent sunburning.
1
Totally put white grainy white stuff on my face when I put it on. it was too visiblely white for me. Not comfortable to put on, and now I have two of them -_-
2
love the product, upset at how overpriced it is. I understand im paying for convenience but i didnt expect 50% markup. Buy this from costco or even walgreens
5
Bought this on the recommendation of my ex-girlfriend and enjoyed it more than I expected. I don't think I'm ever going back to the cheap slimy stuff again!
4
Great sunscreen and we got it quickly. I definitely would get a larger size if you have a big family. One beach trip and half of it is gone from the tube.
5
This is an excellent value.  I use this stuff all the time, it's not greasy or heavy.  Fantastic price considering you're getting two tubes.
3
The price is great. I like the scent of the product but it's so dry. It dries really fast b4 i can apply evenly on my neck and shoulders.
5
I have been using this every day for years and it works great. I have never had a sunburn and everyone says that I look 10 years younger.
5
Neutrogena is my favorite brand for sunscreen.  I'm still looking for one that isn't quite as greasy feeling, but this stuff sure works.
4
I have been using this sunscreen on my sensitive, fair skin for years. I love it and will keep using it as long as they make it.
5
Very good. I am outdoors all day. The Sunscreen works well.  I  now use it everyday, and have avoided having red skin everyday.
5
Screens the sun just as described. Not oily at all, which I very much appreciate.Great travel size -- fits right in a pocket.
4
Package well.  Arrived on time.  This is a great sunscreen.  Goes on smooth and does not leave your skin feeling oily.
5
Very high quality...I have ultra sensitive skin and it works super.....I love the scent and it goes on pretty clear.
5
I like this product and I have been using it for years. It has a protective sunscreen agent. It is perfect for me.
5
Sunscreens are an absolute must in Florida and Neutrogena is the only one I trust. No grease and great coverage.
5
I bought this because my friend recommended it for my mum. The discount sweetens things. No complaints yet.
2
This would always burn my sensitive skin and make my eyes water sometimes even with a light application.
5
I really love this product. It came on time and fast, and everything work perfectly. Sorry my english.
5
It was so light on the skin. The smell was decent. I feel more confident going out in the sun now.
4
i like this sunscreen because it doesn't leave oily residue on skin. it is absorbed completely
1
I am dark-skinned so this sunscreen makes my skin look ashy-gray. When I sweat it drips white.
5
recommended by the doctor. Has no eye irritation that have experienced with other sun blocks
5
Great sunblock that goes on really smooth. Use these for myself and the family all the time.
5
Really like this Neutrogena product. It is NOT greasy on the skin and protects very well.
5
Fine product, works well, nice package for our emergency kits, will be buying lots more
4
Feel smooth and the sun don't burn as it use to...easy to open and have no bad smell.
5
I received this product today, and thought it was expired, but the lot # on the end is the production date, not an expiration date.  The ones I received today, 3/26/15 were manufactured in April 2014.  I think the shelf life of sunscreen is about 3 years, so I'm fine with this.  This is very good sunscreen.  I am a Melanoma patient and have used this for 5 years.
5
Recommended by my dermatologist! Used by make up artists! Great product!
5
Love this stuff. Goes on smooth and light. This is the only kind I buy
5
i love this stuff.  goes oneasily without a greasy feel.  works well.
5
Not sticky even though you can feel it on your skin. Great protection
5

I have been using this product for years and love it.  I have used it snorkeling and it amazingly stays on my skin most of the day.  The only downside is that if you don't rub i in well, you can see the whiteness of the sunscreen on your skin and in the folds inside your elbows, for example.  It is quite thick, but I am used to that.  All in all, an excellent product.

The first time I use this moisturizer my face started to burn me, I used it a second time and I felt my face burning me again, so I discounted using it.  I used other Neutrogena  products on my face before and this is the first time I have a problem.

Dinged 1 star because of its thickness. I sunburn easily and put in lots of time in a convertible with the top down.  Not a good combination unless you are using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45. When driving season started I couldn't find my regular sunscreen so I picked up a tube of this.  Put it on and I am good for 7 hours of driving at altitude.  Just picked up another 2 tubes for next season. Ultra Sheer is like the energizer bunny - it just keeps on working.

I love lightweight feeling~dry-touch almost like body lotion

Out of most sunscreens this is pretty matte. I have really oily skin so I was happy to have found this. I gave it four stars since I have had better sunscreens from Japan and from other more expensive brands that are  more matte. After a few hours, this did give me a bit of a sheen, in spring.

I experienced an itchy bumpy red rash after using this sunscreen, so I cannot recommend it.  It also burned my eyes terribly when some lotion-tainted sweat ran into them.  I have never had any such issues with Banana Boat or NoAd sunscreens.

Doesn't feel greasy, which is great. Works well.

Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF is a good product. I bought a tube at cvs and it was much high than the twin pkg. The best part  about  on line  buying, it comes right to your door.
2
SPF30 smells much better. you know, the coconut-y, normal sunscreen smell you smell on beach. but this one smells like plastic. ew.

I love the product, but a few days after purchasing it here I found the same twin-pack at Costco (plus a few trial size extras) for a few dollars cheaper. Not worth the hassle of returning, but its frustrating when that happens!

I needed a good sun screen with a little higher SPF and in a packable size for a trip to Greece.  I had used this product before for my face and was pleased with it's more matte like qualities as compared to most other face products with SPF. This worked well for my needs.  It is priced reasonably and this quantity lasted for both of us using it on our arms and faces for the whole trip.

I break out in a red itchy rash every summer when I use sunscreen.  I figured I'd give the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer a try and I'm SO glad I did.  It is not greasy and I was out in the sun alot and I never burned one time.  It is the best sunscreen I've ever used.  However, I broke out just a little but no where near as miserably as I usually do.  I will most definitely use Neutrogena from now on.

I purchased this product for my 8 year old son who has very sensitive skin.  The main issue I have with this product is that it never rubs in fully, which makes it's name "ultra sheer" very misleading.  It leaves you white for the entire day.  It also isn't that great for sensitive skin and my son said it stung when I rubbed it on.  I've had better luck with the spray version of Neutorgena.

Like many other people, I bought this sunscreen because of all the great reviews on this website. Honestly, after using it a few times, it does the opposite of what it promises. I have tried this, the spray, and the clear face and they ALL burned my skin, felt extremely greasy (especially on my face) and no matter how long I waited after I applied it it immediately streaked down my face/eyes when I sweat or went in the water. It is strong, I have not burnt when using it (and trust me I burn within 5 minutes without sunscreen) but I feel like people who have these problems dont apply the proper amount. The amount for the face alone should be a shot glass full, and even more on each area of the body. And im sorry, I like in Buffalo where you dont have nice days without extreme mugginess, the last thing I want to feel when I am hot and sweaty in greasy and sticky. Really disappointing.

The GOOD: -Keeps you from getting sunburns -Tolerable smell -Easy to rub in The BAD: -Expensive -Each "tube" only lasts one or two trips to the pool/beach -Sunscreen "pools" in wrinkles, creases, belly button, etc As far as a sunscreen goes, you aren't going to get burnt with this stuff on. Apply once and you're good to go. If you sweat a lot or get in the water you will need to reapply. If you can't tolerate that "sunscreen smell", don't get this. It's not too bad or noticeable, but it is there. The lotion rubs in easily and seems to soak in... until you start sweating. I ended up with white puddles in all the creases (elbows, neck, belly buttons) and a white mustache where the lotion pooled above my upper lip. Yes it keeps you from getting burnt, but there is no reason to pay a premium for this stuff as it doesn't offer any additional benefits. Go with something cheaper that will last longer, or something "natural" if that's what you're looking for. Recommended: Nah

delighted with this product

I used to use them mainly because I thought they don't test on animals, However, after reading about "greenwashing" - yes they in a way test on animals. I will never buy neutrogena products ever again. "A good example of this greenwashing can be seen via Neutrogena, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, that regularly conducts animal tests.  However, their recently-launched Neutrogena Naturals line boasts serene, eco-friendly looking bottles that state: ?This product not tested on animals.?  Well, that?s nice.  What this really means is that this one iteration of this product has not been tested on animals, but the raw ingredients, combinations therein, and any other products the company makes may have been."

GIFT TO A RELATIVE

maybe this is a good sun screen but for dry skins... specially under my make up... it's awful! when it dries it becomes like powdery and imagine how does a foundation work on it... It's not gonna work actually.

I ordered two of these since it's hard to find 3oz sunblock's to travel with in the winter. They came quickly as promised, however one of the items was not properly sealed.  The actual container leaked through the top. My husband even tried to hold a lighter under it to reseal it. That worked for a bit but once we got to our destination it started leaking again. Pretty disappointed that it got all over my stuff!
