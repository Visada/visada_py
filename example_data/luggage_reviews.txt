First off, it should be mentioned that there are at least two different bags being advertised together on the same page. These bags are NOT interchangeable and have different features and dimensions. I discovered this because I ordered the red bag for my son and the carbon bag for my husband. The red bag is two inches deeper and 1.5 inches wider, which is an issue if you're concerned about stringent carry-on allowances. The smaller, carbon bag does NOT expand, despite the description and title stating otherwise (the red bag is expandable). Please see the images I've uploaded for more details on the dimensions. Let me start with the bag interiors because these details are not shown on the website (I've since posted pictures). The interior of the red bag is bubble gum pink with white polka-dots. I have no idea who thought that was a good idea, but I wonder how many of the other bags share this interior color choice. My step-sister has the purple bag and says it's the same pink pattern. This pink fabric feels and looks cheap. It's thin and feels as if it will tear easily. The carbon bag has a gray interior with a whimsical polka-dot pattern. It feels sturdier as it isn't so thin. It also is more attractive to look at, but is still somewhat feminine due to the nature of the pattern. There are multiple storage pockets in the carbon bag, whereas the red bag has only one. I've posted pictures showing the bag interiors. The exterior of these two bags is noticeably different. The red bag has a matte finish and is textured; whereas the carbon bag is smooth and glossy. I prefer the textured matte finish on the red bag because it won't show scuffs as easily. The weight of the ABS is drastically different with the carbon bag having a much thicker shell and little flexibility to it. The exterior of the red bag, on the other hand, is surprisingly thin which allows it to flex. We haven't used either bag on a flight yet, so I can't speak to their durability, but the carbon bag feels sturdier (and is heavier). The two bags have different wheels. The red bag rolls more easily and is more fun to maneuver as a result. The wheels on the carbon bag have a gap between the wheel casing and the wheel itself. This leads me to think that these wheels may begin to wobble more quickly/easily. I've posted pictures of the wheels alongside the wheels of my higher-end carry-on suitcase. The red bag's wheels are more similar to this mid-upper tier bag's wheels, which perhaps explains the ease of motion of this bag. The handle on the carbon bag wobbles less as it is supported by a snug fit in the bag frame. The telescoping handle on the red bag does wobble due to a gap between the rods and the bag's frame. The rods themselves appear identical in construction, so the differences here may not affect the longevity or durability of the bag.

I LOVE this piece of luggage.  It is extremely light and extremely easy to travel with, since it has the four wheels.  I have taken this on two one-week trips and several long weekend trips since purchase, and it has held up well.  It's small, but for me that's a positive as it forces me to pack well and it's so easy to take around when I am traveling. Other reviews have noted that it is not very durable.  It has held up so far for me, but if/when it gives out I will DEFINITELY purchase another one...even if it only lasts a year, it would be worth it for me because of ease of travel.  I travel a lot, and lightweight luggage is extremely important to me.  The price was right here, and the free shipping of course made it worth it. Update: I've had this suitcase for almost a year now, and I have taken it all over the world:  for a week in Italy, two weeks in Panama, and many, many shorter trips.  It's still going strong.  The inside pocket tore when I overpacked heels into it, but that really was my fault, not the suitcase.  The frame has been extremely durable, and I do not go easy on my stuff.  The body is a little scuffed, but otherwise it's in great shape.  I have convinced all of my friends that they need this suitcase as well!  :)

I've used this on one trip so far, roundtrip NY/LA checked on 2 different airlines, so the rating may go up (or down) after more trips. Overall, I'm very satisfied. I was amazed at how much STUFF I could pack into this thing (4 pairs of pants, 8 shirts, 1 pair of safety shoes, 2 sets of pajamas, the usual socks/underwear/bras/toiletries) plus room to spare - WITHOUT expanding the bag. Full, it was still very light and mobile. The bag made the trip without incident-not even a scuff. (I didn't try taking it as a carry-on, but it looks like it would fit without issue.) What really impressed me though, was how this bag survived my 2.8 yr old son, aka Destructo. Not only did he think it great fun to push around, (demonstrating the stable wheel base on linoleum, tile, carpet, and wood) he laid it down (full) at the foot of our bed and proceeded to use it as a springboard, jumping off the bed, onto the suitcase, onto the floor. Repeat in reverse direction (going back up). Repeat ad nauseum. Figure he weighs about 30 lbs and he did this around 50 times. No damage to the suitcase or the contents (including a sealed full mouthwash container and a bag of goldfish crackers). To me, this says a LOT about how this will hold up during airport handling. This is much more than I can say for the Coleman hard side that I bought. I haven't even used the Coleman yet, but when Destructo tipped it over on the kitchen floor, the piece holding the base of the retractable handle inside the shell popped out. (Hubby repaired it, but this is BEFORE the Coleman has even been on an airplane or used as a toddler springboard.)

I received this as a wedding shower gift and it was a great bag to take on our honeymoon trip.  It is just within the carry-on limits (even on terrible, awful, rip-off airline FlyBe--who made us check the other carry-on we had).  It is also very light when empty, so you can actually put things into it, and not worry as much if they weigh your carry-ons.  We traveled with it for three weeks on planes, a car, on trains, and of course walking down the street and didn't have any problems with it in terms of durability. Since it is a hard-cased bag, it doesn't have any external pockets, so that might be a minus.  But on the inside, the upper part has a separate zippered compartment that is helpful for organizing and you can fill it and not have everything fall out when you open it.  We registered for the red one because it was the cheapest at the time.  Make sure to click on each color and compare the prices.  You might end up paying $20 or more just for a more desirable color.

I bought two as gifts.  The cases arrived in good time and in perfect condition.  Love the color, design and construction of this product.  I was hesitant to purchase, based on a couple of questionable reviews, one being that the zippers were installed backwards.  Not so. The cases are as nice, or better, than most hard sided, expandable cases I have seen at 2x the price.

I bought this and a Samsonite Winfield 20" spinner at the same time. I returned the Samsonite because, with handle and wheels counted in, it exceeds the airline spec of 22 inches. This suitcase was a good size, met the airline specs and in practice fits well in the over head compartments.  The interior is pretty basic, with a zippered cover for the top half and one zippered pocket on the other half. More organizing pockets would have been appreciated. The exterior is an attracctive, textured and striped black design.  In one month of usage I have not scratches or nicks. But, this is a big but, after one month of use, roughly 3 airline trips, one of the wheels has failed and now wobbles such that I cannot push it along on four wheels.  After less than 30 days, the bag is now in effect useless for me. I'm trying to figure out how to get warranty repair on it.  If I recall came with a tag stating a 5 year warranty. So buyer beware.

This is a great piece of luggage. Rolls well, zips easily and holds a lot. Unfortunately it didn't fit into Delta's carry on sizer bin and I had to check it. But I will keep it and continue to use it in the future.

This bag does not measure 9 x 13 x 20 as advertised.  It is actually 9 x 15 x 23 an that does not include the handle!  I ordered this bag to meet the international airline carry-on requirements and this bag is more than 2 inches too big. I advised Amazon and was told that I was sent the wrong bag; so they sent another one --- and it was still the wrong size. I checked the sizes listed on Amazon for several bags, including Delsey and Samsonite, against the actual luggage company sites, and in 9 out of 10 cases, Amazon had the incorrect dimensions listed. I am an Amazon fan - but this is ridiculous.

Looks great & seems sturdy but I couldn't get the sting plastic smell out after 2 days in my garage.  Even my hand smelled after I touched it.  Then I noticed a warning sticked  that states this product uses chemicals that are known to cause cancer & birth defects.  I can't get the smell off my hand either.  I'm greatful for the warning sticker & the free return policy.

I've traveled multiple times with this suitcase and it's my favorite to use.  I even took it on a weeklong trip to Hawaii and carried it on, in expanded mode.  It held enough for the whole trip and then some, and it's sturdy, rolls beautifully, and is lightweight.
5
At first i was a little skeptical about it. But when i started filling it with clothes i realized that i could put lots of stuff there. Also it was delicious to travel with. I didnt have complains using it as a carry on. It fit to inside the plane.

I've only taken it on a couple of trips but so far, so good. The color and design is great. It seems to be a little flimsy, but it has not failed.

First off I would like folks to know that I buy regularly on Amazon and pay particular attention to reviews. If I like a product I would give it a 5 star. This product SUCKS!. I have been on only 1 road trip with this so far. Yesterday I packed 2 suits, 4 shirts and misc. items for a trip. As I was carrying the bag down the stairs the handle just broke off!! I am stuck with this because Amazon says its beyond the return date (I bought this earlier this year). But, I would like to advise folks -  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! The quality is awful.
1
It looked nice out of the box, the day before we left on vacation. Telescoping handle is cheaply made and wobbles, feels like it will break any minute. On our first day of vacation the handle on the suitcase broke off as my husband put it in the shuttle. Hmmm, not a good sign! On the fourth day the fabric of the zipper started ripping. Definitely proves that you get what you pay for. The blue one I bought at the same time did not break or tear but it's handle was weak also. Splurge for a good one.

I bought this about a year ago and have used it to get to 20 of the 50 states as well as the western half of Europe on planes, trains and automobiles. While, as some other reviewers have noted, the suitcase did get some scratches the frame itself never caved. It served as both a checked bag and a carry on. The wheels rotate around which make it ideal when running around changing trains or planes, it won't slow you down and rolls very smoothly. Also very aesthetically pleasing and not a pain in the butt which is more I can say about my carry on duffle bag. The one complaint I have is that if you pack the outside area too heavily it does have a tendency to tip over after you stop rolling it. Also note that most of the time it will be side check in at airports because its too fat in the middle when fully packed with the extensions in use but I've never had a problem with getting my carry on any plane or train I have been on with a size restriction. There is also no lock on the wheels which is sometimes a problems when on a steep hill. Overall awesome for 3 to 4 day trips but not more than that. It can only carry so much (although I've had it hold about 50 pounds before)if only because it is small.

I took this on my around the world trip and have return home with holes in the sides and nicks at the corners. It is very light weight and the wheels work great. The down side is that it is not very durable.

Ordered four of these for family.  Pink, Silver, and two Red. Silver had gray interior, Pink had pink interior and much to my horror the Red cases had pink polka-dot interiors! Yikes - they were ordered for two young boys. That will never fly.(reason for 4 instead of 5 star rating). Called Amazon to see if they could tell me interior fabric colors of the orange or purple or blue. Nope - couldn't find it anywhere. That being said they seem like they will be great to travel with as carry-ons. Very light. Love the four wheels. Guess I will just have to order the Silver for the boys since I know what color the interior is.

I was in the market for a hardshell spinner carryon with easily-identifiable color/design and this fit the bill.  I've just returned from a quick roundtrip with today with this carryon.  Upon first review, I noticed that the parts were all in working order, but not of particularly high quality. I was quite disappointed with the interior lining: it's very thin nylon--thinner than your typical reusable nylon grocery bag. I packed the bag pretty full but did not need to use the expansion zipper and it fit in the overhead compartment well. Upon arrival at my destination, I found that the nylon on the zip compartment had torn away from the zipper with no hope of repair because it had also started to fray. In packing up again for departure, I noticed that the zipper was not functioning properly as it was skipping teeth here and there. I had to unzip and re-zip at a slower and more deliberate rate. Upon arrival at home, I found that the nylon on the zip compartment had deteriorated in a different area. I had packed this section very loosely given that it was already torn. However, a hole had developed in the middle of the pocket in a separate location, seemingly due to friction from a soft makeup bag in the main compartment. This luggage interior CANNOT handle wear and tear.

Opened box to find large 'contains products known to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm' signage. Inspected luggage - really lightweight but not sturdy, plastic wheels that look as is they will crack at any moment, the pull out handle shakes easily and feels as if its about to fall out. The interior material is so cheap, 8 mean so super thin and appears it will tear if one were to pull the zipper to hard. I should have known the deal was too good to be true. This is going back tomorrow.

I am a weekly business traveler.  I have used this piece for almost 5 months now.  This thing is rocking along like a charm.  I honestly dont think this thing will ever die.  I (along with every single airline) have put this thing through HELL already and it just doesnt quit.  Still in perfect shape.  This little guy is my best friend - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
2
The first thing I noticed was that the bag seemed a bit taller than other 20" bags I'd seen so I measured it an what'd ya know, it's actually 21.5".  I travel internationally quite a bit and would rather not have the hastle of chancing my bag being able to be a carry on or not. The main thing that brought down the rating for me was the extendable handle.  It feels like if the wind blew hard enough it would twist and snap.  The construction feels really flimsy and the slightest bit of stress on it makes you cringe.  I love 4 wheel roller bags but this one definitely has to be kicked along instead of using the handle. The rest... well, it looks like what you'ld expect, not great but not horrible.  Zippers could definitely be better.... Would I buy it again?  No.

Unwilling to pay the fee to check a bag on my recent trip to Hawaii, I managed to fit everything for a week into this carry-on.  From now on, I will travel "light" with my fire engine red sidekick.  It's great luggage at an affordable price.

I bought this suitcase for a recent trip to Hawaii.  I didn't want to pay the check-in fee ($50.00!) so I bought this case for the trip and future trips.  It looks small, but it really does hold a lot.  I packed 4 pairs of shorts, 7 shirts/blouses, a dress, a light cardigan, flip-flops, undergarments (a lot), a gallon  plastic zipper bag full of toiletries, brushes, a makeup bag and lots of other necessities and still had plenty of room left.  The suitcase fit into the overhead bin on the planes perfectly.  I purchases quite a few souvenirs (t-shirts, travel mugs, cookies...) and as I packed it all for my flight home, I began to panic a bit when I couldn't close the suitcase!  However, when I unzipped the extension zipper, I was able to close the suitcase.  Then when I sat on the suitcase, I was able to zip the extension zipper closed and have the suitcase back to it's original size.  It was a bit of a struggle, but it worked out great and thank goodness I didn't forget to pack anything and I din't need to open that sucker again until I arrived home. This suitcase worked great for me and I am pleased with my purchase.

I just took this suitcase on two trips - one from the US to Europe and one from the US east coast to the west coast. It was checked both ways on the Europe trip and one way on the west coast trip. It came through the checking process just fine.  It had a few scuffs, most of which wiped off with a damp cloth so that it looked new again.  It fit perfectly in the overhead bin for the one leg I carried it on the plane. For one of the trips we stayed in a different hotel every night so the case had a lot of moving in and out of the car trunk, through parking lots, and up and down stairs and elevators into hotels, etc. It came through it all great. The wheels have been working fine. I am a little concerned that the extendable handle is kind of wiggly and loose, and I'm afraid it might eventually break. This is most noticeable when I'm pushing rather than pulling the case. To help with this, when pushing it, I only extend the handle up halfway - plenty high enough for comfortable pushing and gives the handle a bit more strength. The zippers have worked great - no problems there. The extra 2 inches that the expansion provides (easily done by unzipping one zipper) is really helpful and adds much more space than you would think.  I am very happy with my purchase and am thinking of buying a second one.

I was initially skeptical of this piece of luggage, because I am shallow and judge product integrity solely by the picture on Amazon. But upon usage I was incredibly impressed, not only with the external appearance, but with the functionality of the product. The bearings in the wheels or the wheels themselves, are incredibly smooth acting and have not jammed. The case, being hard-sided, is slightly malleable such that it is not noisy, but still maintains its rigidity. The internal dividers are logically laid out and easy to use. The dividers also make packing a snap, because you can organize clothing and items as you will need them during your trip. Lastly, this carry-on was light and easily maneuverable. This carry-on is a joy to use. I recommend in heartily to anyone who needs a hard-sided carry-on.

The luggage is small but can contain a lot things: in my case, it carried a pair of shoes, a pile of clothes, some books and some small stuff and is still in good shape after a two-week trip. It's light and the wheels worked really well ? though too agile when it was on the bus, it kept running away and I had to grab the handle all the way. One thing to remind: the luggage is expandable, but some airlines might not accept it as carry-on luggage when use the extra space. In my case, I ended up paying $25 for this "carry-on" luggage after I stuffed some extra things into it.

I suspected buying a suitcase for this price was a stretch being a frequent flyer, but I had to try. Took it on its maiden flight this week and noticed right off when pushing it on its spinners the handle flexes all over the place making it difficult to navigate.  It shouldn't be an issue on the return flight home since the bag was easy to spot on the baggage carousel with the crack the entire length of the bag and pieces of clothing sticking out. If you need a "one way" bag this is the one for you... If you're like the rest of us travelers and actually plan on using the bag on your return leg home this may not be the bag for you. I would like to write more but need to go buy a suitcase for the trip home...

My husband bought this piece from Amazon for me. it looks very nice and the size is perfect but the handle is very cheaply made. It wobbles. During my first trip, the handle broke off (see picture) and I had to buy a new suitcase during my vacation!
1
The suitcase seems like fine quality, it is just bigger than the stated size.  I needed a suitcase that I could carry on for a United Airlines flight.  Their policy is maximum size of 22 x 14 x 9.  This piece is 22 x 15-1/2 x 10.  I returned it.
4
Rolls nicely, and is very light weight. I've used it 4-5 times and like it better than the standard ones I've had in the past. Except for the funky hinge for the top, it is pretty good quality.

Used this suitcase for the first time, the inside zipper pulled away from the cheap fabric. Made and looked cheap.

Decided to purchase an affordable 'spinner wheel' piece of luggage during a spell of frequent travelling for business. I have only used it once so far, but am very pleased with the purchase.  It is the perfect size for the 2-3 day trip and is so much easier to maneuver through airport crowds, and especially down the airplane seating aisle.  No more having to pick the luggage up once I set foot onto the airplane and carry it in front of me as I travel down the aisle, slowly waiting for the movement to my seat.  That, in itself made it a worthwhile purchase.  I have a larger piece that I purchased (different manufacturer, same style) 3 years ago for an overseas trip, and have since wanted a smaller overhead piece for the short trips.  Well worth the reasonable price.
4
It covered my week-long conference with sufficient storage space. It was suitable for a short business trip. Overall, I like it.
5
I am absolutely in love with this piece of luggage. It's so light weight and moves with ease. I'm not a hard core business traveler that would use this on a regular basis, but I do travel quit a bit and I love this little guy. For all you men wanting to buy the color RED it came with PINK interior liner, which as a woman I don't mind, but you know what I'm getting at. I'm very pleased with my purchase!
5
This little thing is the best! Very roomy, glides like a swan, I didn't even have to drag it... Just lightly pushed it along in front if me. No back pain, no fatigue from lugging it around. Got the bright orange one, people on the plane were asking who made it. It just slides right into the overhead compartment with such ease. I was laughing to myself at people punching their hefty, obviously too large, suitcases into the compartment. Never again will that be me!

I love the suitcase. Really. The orange is great (the interior is gray, not pink like some of the others are complaining of in their suitcases). I needed a durable carry on to take on weekend trips and short visits home to Florida. It looks sturdy and protects everything well, but after one flight from ATL to GNV (Gainesville, FL), it came out with scratches and dings. On the commercial flight, it was almost too large to fit in the overhead bin correctly (I didn't expand it) because the bottom of the case is actually larger than the top instead of being more square-shaped. So, we had to stuff it in sideways, which sucks for full flights with limited overhead bin space. I transferred to a smaller jet in ATL and had to stow my luggage. Maybe the smaller jets and the people loading them are rougher on luggage; all I know is it shouldn't have taken such an obvious beating. On my return flight, even more scratches and dings appeared. This time, a piece was also torn off the back so that it doesn't lay flat on its back anymore to pack and unpack. This is unfortunate. All my things were safe and undamaged inside, but I don't know how many flights this can really take. As a pure carry on that is never checked, it's great; but if it's checked, be aware that you're probably going to see your luggage roughed up quite a bit when you are reunited. Bottom line: Great color, great storage capacity, easy to roll and carry, but not as durable as it should be for a hard case. Update 1/7/15: It took less than 2 years for this case to be totally ruined. I traveled back to Florida for winter break, and had problems rolling the case well. I noticed one of the wheels had been dinged up pretty badly, so it wasn't rolling as smoothly as the other 3 wheels. I then traveled from Florida to Milwaukee, and the wheel was even worse; even a friend who helped pull my luggage along asked what was wrong with it. When I got back home to New York, it had been abused too many times. The wheel has almost been torn completely off the case. Fortunately, nothing inside was damaged, but now I have to replace it. I typically use this as my carry on, but I've checked it maybe 6-7 times in less than 2 years, and this is how it comes out. I love the case, but it's just not durable enough to use as a checked bag, and I'm not sure how well it would do with typical wear and tear and more foot travel either. I'll be buying another Delsey now.

This is a good size and fits international carry on requirements which is smaller than US.  Extremely light weight so was easy for a petite person to lift up etc. the zipper inside is convenient.. I used it to separate clean clothes from dirty. However one major disappointment was the spinner wheels. I hoped to be able to move it on all 4 wheels on the side so that it is easy to navigate in narrow lines and doorways. This just does not work. I am have to just spring for a Rimowa or a Tumi.
5
Very well done but I must say the handle is a little bit loose, take note on this to improve the product.
5
I bought this as a gift for my daughter. Absolutely the best price by far on this item was on Amazon. I would place this as "middle of the road" quality wise but WAY, WAY cheaper than the next rung up the ladder. I think you would have to get into the mid $200's to beat significantly the quality here for lett than $65. I will take that any day. Great color selection on Amazon as well.

This carry-on is "ok", but you just need to know what you're getting and set expectations accordingly. (For the record, this is my first roller carry-on. Previously I've always used a backpack when I travel.) First of all, I was hoping for a smaller than normal carry-on. I don?t bring a very much when I travel, so I don?t need the extra space. Some reviews mentioned how this bag was ?small?. In fact, the bag does meet the carry-on size requirements (I even checked in the size checker at the airport with two different airlines, it fits). However, it only just fits. My flight was on an MD-88 (3 seats on one side, 2 on the other). It fit fine on the 3-seat side, but I had to put it in sideways on the 2-seat side. Personally, I was hoping for something that would be smaller than ?as large as possible without being too large?, but that?s simply preference. Also, there are no exterior pockets. Again, this is just preference, but once I was out using the bag I realized that I would rather have a bag with exterior pocket for quicker access to certain items. The quality is a ?you get what you pay for? situation. It?s adequate, but certainly not great. The exterior hard plastic seems fine for any normal use, but probably wouldn?t hold up to being banged around too much. It also scuffed pretty easily (I don?t mind, but worth mentioning). The extendable handle wasn?t great. It didn?t fit snuggly into its track, so it has more play than it should. I felt like I had to go easy on it to avoid damaging it. The wheels are fine for indoor use, but I wouldn?t recommend it for the sidewalk. All in all, it?s an alright bag, especially for the price. It just wasn?t what I was expecting.

Purchased this for a trip to Denver -- used it my carry on item on my way there, and checked it on the way back. I was able to fit (for carry on): - (1) Pair of Jeans - (6) T-shirts - (1) Hoodie - (2) Blouses - (1) Bathing Suit - (2) Pashminas - (1) Dress - (1) Cardigan - (1) Pair of sneakers - (1) Pair of slip on shoes - Multiple Pairs of Undergarments & Socks - Plus misc toiletries, makeup, hair dryer, etc. And I had room to spare. I specifically chose this piece of luggage because it is smaller than what most of the major airlines will accept as the maximum carry on size. I was flying Frontier Airlines & their restrictions are a bit intense, and if you are not careful you will find yourself at the gate being told your bag must be checked and being charged $50. On the way back, my husband and I shared his carry on for half of my clothes and used the extra room to bring home some amazing Colorado beer by checking the bag. We brought back about (7) 22oz bottles & (6) 12oz bottles, packaged in Ziplock bags & wrapped in t-shirts. Everything survived the journey from Denver to NYC. I also found it incredibly easy to maneuver, and it's quite light weight. For $55 an excellent investment.

I thought this luggage would be a bit more sturdy and able to take all the bumps and bruises you would expect during travel, so I ordered it for my mom. She has never had a rolling luggage piece like this and I thought it would be perfect for her. I gave it to her for Xmas and I was a bit disappointed. The fabric in the inside is pink, which if didn't know and kind of clashes with the red outside. It's pretty flimsy compared to my Heys carry on. The fabric started coming out of the inside and it doesn't "roll" as smoothly as some other luggage pieces. I don't think I will order one from this company again.
5
This has been everything I expected. The wheels rool with ease. No problem fitting it into the upper compartments. Very happy with my order.
4
features i like: - compact, fits in overhead bin - nice purple color, easy to distinguish from other baggage - 4 wheels can roll in any direction (though a tad bit difficult to maneuver in all 4 directions - easier to just pull it on 2 wheels) - two main compartments with a thin pocket for smaller items - expandable zipper - zipper lock available inside (easy to use with a 3-number code of your choice) overall, it's a simple and practical piece of luggage. i've already traveled from detroit to hawaii to detroit to punta cana with this as a carry-on over the past 6 weeks, and i've had no troubles with breakdown. i only wish there was an outside pocket for last minute stashes, but that would defeat the purpose of the "shell" style, so i'm ok without it.
4
The color stands out and I found that especially helpful while waiting for gate checked bags.  It struggles on carpet though.  I really like that you can section the two sides of the bag.  Keeps my shoes away from my clothes
5
I liked this suitcase and thought it was a good value for the price.  It is super light-weight so easy to get into the overhead compartment.  Fits great up there.  I could also cram alot of stuff into the suitcase.  I think that this no-nonsense case holds more than those cloth suitcases with all of the zippered outside pockets.  In my opinion those just add bulk but don't hold that much extra clothes.  So this is maximum space for a carry on piece.  The wheels work well and the outside zippers are quality enough.  The inside lining isn't of great quality.  I imagine this a suitcase that will last me for 4-5 years.  I've seen this same suitcase in stores for almost twice the price.  I'm very happy with the purchase.
5
a year old and still going strong ... has been thru several airports and survived without a scar thus far ... I like the 4 wheels so much better than the ones you have to drag behind you ... and I love the color because it is easy to pick off the luggage carousels!
5
Ours has traveled from South Dakota to Antarctica without a scratch or glitch.  Rolls and maneuvers as fast as needed through airports and hops right onto x-ray conveyors and into taxis.  Strong but lightweight, deceptively roomy and DOES INDEED MEET FAA CARRY-ON REGULATIONS.

I bought this for a quick trip and didn't want to pay the damn luggage fee, but wanted to bring lots of stuff. This carry on luggage was a life saver. Good material and very beautiful.

This bag met all my expectations. It is great for short trips. Very light - I have neck/shoulder issues, so I need a lightweight bag. Only drawback is that it has clam-shell opening feature; you have to flop the whole thing open. It's difficult if you need something quickly - especially on TSA line. Other bags enable you to open just a flap and access entire bag.

This case looks nice, and held up well while I tugged it through a couple day art-convention and 2 airports, plus looks high quality and fashionable, but loses a star due to it feeling flimsy in a few spots. The handle especially feels loose and bendy, mostly when you are rolling it on all 4 wheels and you twist the handle to turn the case, it bends quite a bit before the case will turn. Not sure how long it will last, but it hasn't deteriorated since I bought it, just doesn't feel super tight and strong. I don't think it will break, but it is just a bit worrying feeling it flex while trying to walk around airport foot traffic, wrestling it onto planes, and getting it into cars. The Case itself is abs plastic so it also feels a bit flimsy around the edges where it has a zipperable expandable section, but has a metal frame around the main bit so I don't think that will break anytime soon. Nice interior textiles and tons of space, good size for a 1 week trip and still fits within the new carry-on size limits. The wheels roll very nice and are very smooth over various surfaces, they look simply and cheaply made, but well made enough to last through the life of the bag. As long as it all holds together, I'd say this is a fantastic bag for a great price. Any bag you find at this price elsewhere looks cheap and drab.

this item was poorly made-- the support panels were not padded at all, and would leave ridges in my clothes.  also the configuration is wrong for me  I want a deep bottem and shallow lid, and this suitcase is exactly cut in half (equal room in both.)  I am trying to get the info i need to return.

I took the rockland luggage on an 8 day Europe tour with 9 flights; I wanted a carry on that fit the most stringent airline standards and this was it. The luggage body was sturdy, scratch resistant, lightweight and extremely spacious - even held my huge coat after the expansion. However, the handle became loose after just a couple of days traveling - the screws  lost their threading making it difficult to roll, lift and handle. It's a good thing it has 2 additional handles for lifting. Even if the handle hadn't become loose the bars are not sturdy and don't lock mid-way through easily (can be rigged). If the handle was fixed it would definitely  be a keeper, the price is great and the body is awesome, but you buy a spinner to handle with the handle and that failed, miserably. The inside stitching was frayed and loose when it arrived, that also seemed to come apart a little more by the time my trip was done.  Amazon was kind enough to refund it after my trip due to it being defective,  despite being used. You're the best Amazon.

Out of the box I'll echo what others have said. The handle seems really flimsy. It's somewhat difficult to get the handle to lock into position and feels like if you abuse it that it will break. The materials known to the state of CA cancer warning is a bit odd. I can't think of what the issue would be here. The 5 year warranty is a joke seeing as you have to pay $40 for handling. Just accept you bought a $40 piece of luggage as is and move on. On the upside, I don't plan on abusing it so I think ultimately I'll be happy with it. It rolls well enough on two or four wheels and is the size I was looking for. There are several extra things on the inside for storage segregation that I think I'll probably take a razor blade to and cut away to make the interior a little larger. Considering everything I looked at the Dept store was $100, I'm happy with the $40 Chinese knock off
3
Pros: This hard-shell spinner luggage fits into any airline carry-on, wheels easily, and has two handles (one on top and one on the side) for lifting.  The wheels have endured a fair amount of punishment and continue to work.  There is an extra zipper that runs around the circumference of the luggage that, when unzipped, allows the luggage to expand an extra couple of inches.  The inside is split into two compartments, one secured by a zippered partition and one by an elastic band with a plastic buckle. Cons: As a hard-shell luggage, there are no external pockets.  The zippers are plastic and and the zipper for the internal partition broke within a week of purchase (although, to be fair, I was trying to squeeze a lot of stuff into that partition).  Forget about the product warranty, as it requires a $40 shipping and handling fee to redeem.

I love this suitcase!  In the last year it's traveled overseas several times and been rolled for 15 miles on sidewalks, pavement and over cobblestones.  It has easily fit in overhead compartments and survived being checked.  It is light, easy to use, easy to zip up and fits way more in it than I could have imagined.  One of my travel companions didn't bring a bag with wheels, so we even used my suitcase as a carrier for his luggage for a multi-week trip! However, after all this, it's become a little rickety, and the retractable handle is not as strong as it used to be. I think the suitcase is very good value.  Since I've clearly proven the value of a roller suitcase to myself, the next one I get will probably be better quality.  I plan to use this one till it dies!

I ordered two of these cheap suitcases for the recent 10 day trip to Italy my husband and I took (we were using public transportation the whole time, so went with just carry-on sized stuff -- excellent idea!) and I must say, we are both crazy impressed.  These bags held up under some seriously grueling conditions.  The roads in Italian cities are cobblestone, uneven rock slabs, or some combination of both, and these rolled over all surfaces beautifully.  At no point did the wheels give out, slip a bearing, jam up (even though we rolled through some pretty unpleasant stuff) or otherwise malfunction.  They held everything we needed or wanted -- and then some!  I am so happy with this purchase.  I will be using this suitcase on future trips, that is for sure.
1
Loved the way this case looks, nice and light, liked the orange color option, but one of the feet side opposite the handle came off first flight I checked it in to, perhaps better as carry on only.
1
Yes, it looks good.  I was overwhelmed at the mothball/chemical smell when I opened it.  I set it outside on my enclosed porch hoping that the smell was in the packaging and not the item.  While it was airing, I looked at the other reviews.  CANCER?  Yes, there is a tiny sticker on one of the tags that materials used in making the bag can cause reproductive cancers.  This is a silver bag, so maybe the other colors don't carry the same warning and smell?  It still smells awful and I am returning it.  Lastly, I would not have noticed the tiny sticker had I not looked for it after reading what others had written.  (there are MANY rave reviews for the bag).
5
Comes with a sticker over the warranty that clearly states that the bag 'contains chemicals that are known to cause cancer and damage to your reproductive system'. Amazon, hello! Who can I see about this? Bag looks great.  Materials are pretty cheap, but I only paid a third of the full $120.00 price.  If I don't die from having the bag in my home, I'll use it until I find something better. I'm going to spray down the bag and hope that adds a few years back to my life.  The Internet will kill us all, all of us looking for a cheap deal on luggage.
5
I travel a lot and was struggling with balancing packing needs with increased airline space constraints.  This bag answers every need.  It is spacious but compact, easy to maneuver (even for a wimp), sturdy and cute as can be.  The handle does seem a bit wobbly, but my beau has man-handled it (to my chagrin) and it has bounced right back.  I have put this bag to the test and it has passed with "flying" colors.  We have nicknamed it R2D2...I wouldn't want to travel without it.
5
Best deal on luggage I've ever gotten. I got the Carbon Black (vertical ridges, fake carbon fiber). Looks great, solid, doesn't fall down even when loaded unevenly. You can get a ton of stuff into it. Also it fits under the seat in front of you on the plane in a pinch. The inside was a blueish green pattern, very pretty and there's a zippered divider in between the two sides. I have nothing bad to say about this luggage at all.
1
Durability is subpar - the handle was made so cheap & flimsy it makes it very difficult to navigate. But more so, the smell of the bag is awful. There is an awful, over powering petroleum smell which does not go away & makes my clothes stink!!! And when I return from a trip, I have to store the bag in the attic wrapped in plastic & wash everything.  If I had to do again, I would pass on this one.
2
Great luggage as long as you 'carry-on' yourself. Purchased in February 2014 and thrown to the curb Sept 2014.  As I made the mistake of allowing United Airlines to check it on my return flight home.  They destroyed both the handles and it is useless now.  Proceed with caution*  (ps. I also learned thru UA that any claim must be reported within 24 hours)
5
I was skeptical to purchase due to the low price. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! I've carried this on many international voyages and it has stood up to the test of time! I love the smooth wheels. The stitching around the zipper does seem to not be too sturdy, but it has yet to fail on me! The only real complaint I have is the handle and how it wiggles. Not a major issue. I will purchase again when the need arises.
5
Love this bag as a carry-on!!!
5
This luggage was perfect for my recent quick Europe trip: flying between three countries in six days. I wanted a suitcase that was able to fit in overhead compartment, lightweight and rolled fluidly. This fit all those needs. I rolled up three pairs of jeans, three thin sweaters, six tees, one skirt, one pair of dress pants, socks, and underwear. This all fit in one half of the bag. The other accommodated two pairs of shoes, rain jacket, toiletries and other stuff.
5
Bigger than I thought ! Perfect for my soon to be 6 yr old! Will last through the years! I love it! So does he:-)
5
This case went to Dubai and New York in the last six months.  It belongs to a nine year old, and gets treated accordingly.  It gets dropped, tipped, pushed, sat on, and slept in.  All zippers are in good condition, handle slides up and down easily, and to wear shows.  Good for the money.
5
I wanted a hard case carry-on that fit in Allegiant's requirements, and this was exactly that. It has a nice zippered cover on one side so your things don't fall out when you open it. The handle is plenty long for me (5'5"), and then some.
5
I just got back from a trip and the bag is tough and light. The perfect size. Price was right too.
4
Was exactly as described. Wish the telescoping handle was a little more durable. It has only been used in one trip, so not sure it will hold up. Love the expansion option, which seems to expand it at least an inch or more. So if you buy souviners on vacation you have room to pack them to go home.
3
The handle is a bit loose, and after my third trip no longer locks in the shorter position. If I could figure out how to screw it in tighter I'd be much happier. But it wasn't expensive, and serves its purpose.
5
This luggage held up really well being bounced around airports all day. I was pretty rough on it and had no problems. It also came with a free combination lock, which was great.
5
It is a good looking piece of luggage, and is better than I expected.  Very roomy, with compartments for convenience.
5
I looked at a lot of suitcases online and read a lot of reviews before going with this one.  For the price it's a great deal.  The wheels work well, it doesn't tip and it fits lots of stuff.  I walked my kids to school one day and filled it with all their lunchboxes and stuff and stuff for my work.  I was very happy with how easy it rolled.  And the height of the carry bar is adjustable so my kids were able to pull it along as well at the lower height.  Plus the outside is so hard so you don't have to worry about it getting rained on or dirty.
5
I used my Rockland Melbourne 20 inch luggage on a recent trip and it was great.  I was able to pack everything I needed in it and it fit perfectly in the overhead bin.  I would recommend this luggage to anyone looking for a great carry-on.
4
Great for weekend get a ways. Lite weight, but has a lot of room inside for everything to might need.
5
surprised how light it was when I removed it from the shipping box; looks like it will hold a lot for an upcoming flight
5
Perfect carryon for a trip to Disneyland. Well put together, right size, light weight for a young person to pull. He loved it!
5
This is just what I wanted: a hard case that fits most carry-on guidelines, a color that stands out, at a great price.  I have flown with it twice, and it worked very well.  When I bought it, it had a card in it that said something about toxic chemicals and that people from CA won't have anything to do with it, so I put it out in my garage for a few days to gas off which I think it did pretty much.  The zippers work well, as do the wheels, and the handle.  It is VERY light.  I feel like an olympic athlete when I heave it easily into the plane compartment which it fits nicely into by the way. Like most things these days, if one of those main features goes, it will be throw-away material, so I try to be careful with it, and hope it will last me some time.
5
This little case is great.  I fit 4 days of clothing, 2 pairs of shoes, my camera, toiletries, and a few books inside for a recent trip.  I could fit more days of clothing if it weren't winter and I didn't have to pack sweaters/jeans/boots, and I didn't even have to use the expander.  There is a zipped divider to keep clothing separated, the handle extends and retracts smoothly, and the wheels are multidirectional.  The metallic is distinct enough to make the case easy to identify on a baggage carousel (it looks like a very dark, brushed aluminum), but it is dark enough to look professional and discreet.  At this price, I'm going to buy another one for my daughter.
4
I bought this for short trips from school to home. It fits easily into overhead bins, and I haven't had a problem. I haven't checked it yet, so I can't provide info on how it holds up then, but its good for what I needed it for. My only complaint would be that it came with a slight plastic smell, which is wearing off with time.
4
The four wheeled Carry on is a perfect size. I think it's decent for the price, but the handle is not screwed tight. I used it for 6 days all day long at trade shows, so I feel like I got to know my carry on!! The next one I buy will have a outside pocket. Most hard case one don't, except the Rimowa, but they run about $400 plus. So for the value and size I give it 4 stars. I won't ever travel with-out the four wheeled carry-on .
5
This was a gift. So i didnt want anything with poor quality.  It came on time and was what I expected :)
4
I bought 2 of these for my grandkids. The size is a great for the airplane and sturdy enough to check. Holds a bundle of clothes and "stuff" to do the plane or while on vacation.
5
Arrived as promised. The quality was excellent, the price terrific.  My grand daughter enjoyed the orange color.  Happy I purchased it
5
It was just as they advertised it to be. Very sturdy  easy to hande and the color was great. Thanks
5
The fact that it's a spinner makes it so easy to handle. I'm really fond of  the lightweight luggage which makes handling so much convenient. This piece is also great as a carry on.I got rid of all other pieces of luggage by replacing with this.It's reasonably priced and roomy enough for a getaway for 4-7 days.This is an excellent buy.
5
Not only is the color beautiful but it has lots of room.  I love hardcase for durability and highly recommend.
4
My wife wanted a suitcase to carry on the plane. This fit the bill. It was easy for her to pack and is spacious for its size. Her only complaint was that the hard shell made it slippery to handle when laying down.
5
This luggage is great! Looks exactly like it does in image. Clean and Very compact and wheels seem to work very well! Was a perfect gift to get for my parents for their upcoming trip!
5
I surfed the web to find the best price and brand for this carry-on size spinner.  Saved a lot and when it arrived I was very pleased with my purchase.
5
Grandson and his mom loved it.  The wheels will make it great for a 4 year-old to pull through the airport or up the steps to grandma's house.
4
This suitcase is very nice.  I gave it to my mother for Christmas.  The Champagne color is beautiful.  The only caution is that there is a tag attached that said ,"This product has been known to cause Cancer".. WHAT?!  I have to do some research and find out what the heck they mean...  My poor mom saw the tag after we had left her house on Christmas night.  Be careful with the small print! Otherwise, i's a pretty nice suitcase.
3
The luggage is nice and lightweight, and seems sturdy. The problem is my 4 year old son picked this for himself...I wish it mentioned somewhere that the entire inside lining color is (very) PINK, not expected at all!
4
Purchased this carry on for my 12 year old son, whose favourite colour is red, so I ordered the piece in red.  Imagine the disappoint for a 12 year old boy who opened the luggage on Christmas morning only to find the inside is lined in PINK.  There was no mention of this in the item description and I just assumed the lining would be a neutral colour, or perhaps, RED.  This should be noted in the item description.  Otherwise, great quality!
4
I got this suitcase for frequent weekend bus trips when a large suitcase is not warranted but a purse does not fit everything. I like this suitcase, one half of it is separated by a zipper membrane. The wheels are nice, much easier to navigate this suitcase than a standard carry-on with fixed wheels. Nice hard exterior. My only issue is that when the handle is extended, it is a little unstable and wobbly. The components of the handle are not attached to each other as snugly as they should, so when you are "driving" your suitcase while its completely vertical, the handle gives a bit before actually moving the suitcase.
5
Very nice, enough room, easy to push or pull through the airport.  I am very pleased with this luggage.  It holds enough for me to travel with it, and easily glides through the airplane, as well as through the airport.  Good choice of color as well.  I wish it had an accompanying bag that could slide onto the handle.
5
Purchased this for a trip to Hawaii. It was easy to locate in the luggage carousel after our flight landed and made the trip well.
4
The only negative is the extendable handle.  It isn't tight and feels loose.  I used this luggage piece on a recent trip and it has plenty of room for a 2-3 day change of clothes.  It fits easily in the plane's overhead bin.  The cost excellent.  If the handle was more rigid, I would have rated it as 5-stars.
5
UPDATE FEB2015: I have now owned this for over two years. It has close to 100K miles of travel on it. It has been with me through Poland, Mexico, Italy and just about everywhere in-between. I have used this exclusively as my sole suitcase for these past two years. Other than some minor scuffing, it is still as strong as ever. I did inspect the stitching and seams since I figured it would be dead by now. Everything looks as solid as the day I got it. Despite the endless drops off of sidewalks, gravel littered walkways, and two-years of use, the wheels still roll smooth. To date, this has been my most durable and used carry-on/suitcase. ****ORIGINAL**** I travel a fair bit, around the world, for work. This is my go-to bag for all my needs. With proper packing I can get two weeks worth of clothes in and it still fits in the overhead bin of all but tiny commuter jets. I have wheeled this over cobblestone roads in Portugal to sand in Puerto Rico. It has seen Scotland, England, Spain, Germany, Belgium, and many other places. It looks great and still rolls smooth as the day I got her. It is also very light in weight. The only concern I have is the telescoping handle. There is a fair amount of play when it is fully extended. However, despite the play it has not failed once. I am pretty sure it will continue to work as it should, unless of course someone abuses it.
5
Nice durable carry on. I don't do a lot of flying but this product has room and a relatively hard case. A great piece for the money spent.
5
Light weight, color is beautiful, functional, textured finish for less scratches. I used it on my last long trip and it performed perfectly!
5
Light, roomy, attractive,correct size for carry-on, what's not to like.  Only problem with this order is that delivery service did not put on covered porch, but left on steps in pouring rain..Packaging was soaked and falling  apart, but suitcase is waterproof, so no damage.  Another plus for this item.
5
Great carry on luggage. It's light weight and also can fit a ton of stuff inside. The fact that it expands is even better. I love this luggage, my only complaint is that I waited so long to get it.
4
Delivered in 2 days; just as promised.  Good looking piece of luggage and already used it for a trip.  Holds enough for 3 days as it's expandable.  Took off one star because the handle seems loose but it works fine so far.
5
I Love The inside of the Luggage, because you can pack one side with clothing, you can zip up . And The other you side  can have put things in, with a Elastic over it.
4
Taken this bag on a number of trips and its held up well, have only taken it as carry on but its held up and plenty of space.
3
This size carry-on was allowed on United Airlines. I was able to pack 5 days of summer clothes in it for a trip to NYC. That is the plus. The negatives are that it is kind of flimsy feeling. The telescoping handle is not really sturdy and wiggles a lot. The inside is lined with a thin nylon type fabric. It appears that this fabric is the only thing between your belongings and the handle mechanism. There is just one pocket along the hinge that is about 16 inches long and 3 inches deep. It has a zipper. I got the red one and it has a pink and white polka-dot lining. The spinner wheels were fine and since I carried it on, there was no damage. I would not check this luggage without some sort of belt around it though.
5
I brought this little guy anywhere in the world and it never let me down. Especially when expanded it can hold a surprising amount of stuff, and it will fit perfectly in airplane overhead compartments, which works great for me as I always try to bring my bags as carry-ons after some bad experiences. The design is good and pleasant to look at, and the frame is very light. Definitely a winner, would buy again.
3
I debated giving this carry-on either a 2 or 3. It's a great piece of luggage but it has a very distinct plastic smell/stench to it. You might want to air it out for a week or three but mine is still stinking. I'm not sure if it is every going to go away. I can live with it but maybe you can't.
5
Both pieces of luggage are a Christmas gift for my 6 year old twin grandsons who now want older looking luggage. The luggage is perfect for them and I like the wheels and expandable feature.  In addition to all that, it was on sale. How perfect is that! So we got two of them for the price of one.  A BoGo.  Can't wait to give it to them.  Thank you
4
Product performed as advertised.  Aesthetically appealing, great carry on for a child.  Only complaint was handle would not always remain fullt extended unless you pulled it very hard.
5
Did exactly what I bought it for; held everything I needed for my trip.  And most of all was able to use as a carry on.
5
Fits well in overhead on plane.... Wheels work great. Would recommend this item!!! I am tall and handle is tall enough!!!
5
Grandson's fav color is orange....he loved it!  I am sure he will have it for a long time.....It is very durable and spacious.  I am a little concerned that it will fit in the overhead on a plane.
4
It fit in overhead bins and hold a lot, handles well only time will tell if it is sturdy enough
5
This carry on is very light and sturdy.  It can hold quite a bit given the fact that it is expandable.  The materials used appear to be of a high quality and should be able to endure wear and tear well.  I love the look and feel of this item and would recommend it to others.
5
This bag is great for a carryon or a weekend away. Very sturdy.  Price is good compared to what I have seen elsewhere.
4
When the package arrived the day before my trip i was skeptical. The telescoping handle seemed a bit flimsy. I needed to get a carry on bag to protect my C-Pap machine and my camera and other goodies, so this semi-hard shell seemed good enough to do the job. I am back after a two week trip to Central Europe. It and my equipment survived the journey quite well. Even the telescoping handle was good. The semi-hard case was much better protection than a soft cloth or leather bag. It does not weigh any more than my softer carry on bags and it fit into all the overhead airplane storage compartments. I don't know how it will survive future trips, but it passed with flying colors on it maiden voyage. I gave it a 4 star rating because it does not have an external pocket to store my Kindle Fire or other reading material. You have to open it up after getting through airport security to access your reading material for the flight.
4
this is a great buy for the price but I can tell the handle is not strong enough to last a long time.  if your bag is packed heavy even more risk of wearing it out.  I dont' let my 9 year old roll it as kids tend to be harder on stuff.  it still was a great deal compared to others similar in quality.  I love the luggage regardless.
5
So light weight - love the extras inside - wheels like a dream.  Haven't used in the real world yet but can't imagine it won't be fabulous!  LOVE THE COLOR!
5
Excellent Product  This Product is the same as i hope. i am very happy with the product I will  recommend it.
5
I have taken this only on one international trip and it held up great (6 seperate flights) and it held up fine for me I always make sure to pack it carefully in the overhead storage. it is very light and strong for its size. I like the spin wheels so you can push it if you get tired of pulling it. I put my laptop bag on top and it handled it no problem. Much better than cheaper quality bags you can find at discount stores.
3
I bought this as a gift.  He used it one time and the zipper fell off.  Kinda disappointing.  It does have 4 wheels which are nice and a way to expand the bag which is nice and you don't see much on 20 inch.  I probably will pay a little extra and buy a different bag next time.
5
I used it to travel to NYC for work and I fit 6 days worth of clothes and shoes in it!  Perfect.
3
Bought it for the price and the positive reviews. When I opened the box up, the smell was pretty bad... Took a week of fabreze and letting it air outside before I felt comfortable putting my clothes in without picking up the smell.  Everything seemed good before leaving for my trip but eventually the pull out handle started getting stuck by the third connecting flight.  Overall for the price, it works.
5
I could not be more impressed by the durability and ease of use of this case!  i waited to review this product until it had been on several long haul trips with me.  It has taken the beating all cases do with the airlines on 3 trips from the Southern US to Asia and looks the same today as it did coming out of the packaging originally! I would definitely recommend this Product!
4
light weight; nice color, 4 wheels make it easy to move around. Nice size good for children as not too big
5
very easy for this old man to wheel this piece of luggage. love the expandability of the luggage. not too heavy for us old folks :)
4
Having only made one international flight with the luggage, I can't speak to its longevity. It served me well for now and we'll hope it continues.
3
I really like the look of the suitcase, but was very disappointed that the black "bumper" piece broke the first time it was checked.
4
Super lightweight suitcase. Bought to use on my trip to Poland. I don't like to drag around big suitcases especially overseas so this is perfect. Small enough so its easy to handle but has plenty of room to pack for a few weeks if done correctly. I figure for the price even if I were to only get a few uses out of it, it's worth it with the cost of airline bag fees!!
4
Handle is kinda flimsy but over all really good product. I would purchase another at $50. Love the color and ease of use.
4
Perfect for our European  Vacation. We were able to fit these overhead so we didn't have to worry about our luggage being lost.  We purchased two and they held three changes of clothes for us which was perfect. Two days in between washing. The inside is very roomy and comes with a stretch band on one side and a zipper flap closure on the other side. Great design; Very light weight; and I love the fact that it is a hard case so everything inside is protected
4
Moves great. Sturdy and durable. Great price. Bought it for a weekend getaway to nyc and i love it. Very expandable.
5
I have been looking all over for the perfect lightweight 20" roller suitcase. I even searched all over Chicago on a recent visit, but went home empty handed. When I saw the amazing price on this one I thought..."What do I have to lose"? I am not dissappointed. It's wonderful! I tried it out last weekend on a trip to San Antonio. It was lightweight, rolled very well, had plenty of space & felt sturdy and dependable.
5
This is a winner. I looked at SO many suitcases before buying... and this one is incredible. Outside is beautiful. Bought the red. Love it. The wheels are very easy to handle. Just what I wanted. Inside: two separate spaces, one with inner zipper lid to keep things in place. The other, with the traditional straps. It even has a small zipper pouch the size of an envelope for small things. It's strong, durable. A tiny bit smaller than regulation size, so even on the cheaper airlines you're safe to carry on. A GREAT BUY.
1
I used this piece of luggage ONE time as a carry on.  Warning----the zipper has come undone from the frame rendering it useless.  The suitcase comes with a 5 year warranty, and I can't get anyone to return my emails about a replacement.  DO NOT BUY!  You'll be left with a worthess piece of luggage!  Save your money and use a plastic trash bag!
5
I've now had this suitcase for 2.5 years, so I feel it's finally time to give it a big thumbs up.  This bag has been on many trips, and has withstood a fair amount of abuse - in particular, the quaint but bumpy and uneven cobblestone streets of Copenhagen and my carrying the bag up stairs with the handle extended.  Definitely worth the money!
1
Looks great, packs well, but started falling apart on first plane.  I thought I'd use the "Warrenty" but when I looked up the fine print, I would have to pay a $40 handling fee to replace.  Frustrating.  If you only have car trips to use it on, it's fine, but don't count on checking this bag and having it hold up when flying.

Suitcase overall is ok, however, nowhere on this description does it state that the fabric color is pink with white dots on this red suitcase. I bought 4 of these suitcases, in different colors, the red is the only one with odd fabric inside.  This was a gift for my son, needless to say, he was not impressed.  In dire need of the suitcase,  we needed for a trip and was not able to return with enough time left.

This is a remarkable suitcase for the price!  It's lightweight, compact, and surprisingly durable.  It may appear small at first glance, but with proper packing techniques, you could fit a week's worth of clothes into this modest carry on.  It also has an expansion zipper that will add another couple of inches if you need more space. What I love most about this luggage is the hard shell casing.  Whether you check your bag or stow it in the overhead, your luggage tends to get man-handled--sometimes by airport staff and sometimes by other passengers looking to make room for their own stuff.  Knowing the contents of my case are well-protected within this suitcase's thick shell puts my mind at ease.  It also comes with a free TSA approved lock (in case you're really paranoid). In truth, I was originally looking at the Tumi hard shell carry on, but after purchasing this one, I was happy with my decision.  It offers much of the same functionality and at a fraction of the price.
5
This is adorable and I am glad I bought it. It is perfect for someone who loves pink! It looks like it will stand up to being tossed around if you check it in at the airport.
5
The amount of compartments inside was a delightful surprise--great for organization. I read some other reviews before buying it and knowing ahead of time that the handle piece is not quite as strong as one might anticipate, I was careful with it and no damage was done! It has a very strong outside and the color is great.
1
There is a heavy rubber smell to the suitcase.  I had to air it out before I could use it.  The first time I used it the handle got stuck in the upright position and I could not push it down.  I was a problem on the plane with space because I couldn't put in the proper way because of the handle.  I hate the suitcase, don't buy it.
5
Was even better than we hoped.  It's sturdy and the perfect size with nice organizing pockets. Exactly what we wanted.
5
This is a great piece of luggage for the price! The "carbon" model is especially attractive and well constructed of abs material. The interior is surprisingly roomy with a one-sided zippered retaining wall and storage pouches. This is a perfect piece of luggage for "carry on" airline travel.
4
Overall, a good deal for the price. Wheels roll well, hard case offers good protection and has 2 zippers so you can expand it if you need just that little but more space. I give it 4 stars only because the handle is shaky, I'll be careful not to lift up on it from that point. I paid $41 for the black one.
4
Great little suitcase for the price! Seems a little flimsy (specifically the handle) but so far so good and it's taken quite a few trips with me so far. Fits the smaller carryon luggage requirements for United/Delta/American etc. One star off for handle and for the fact that it arrived already scratched.
5
I love the ways it can roll in any direction.  I always get compliments on the color.  I visited my friend for about a week and a half and I took everything, even shoes,  in this bag.  I love it!
3
It's just o.k. If I hadn't needed it quickley I would have sent it back. It smells of strong plastic and it's also very thin. The handle is pretty wobblely and probably won't last long. I would never check this piece of luggage, I don't think it would make it. I used it as my carry on.
4
Good quality build. The top is not rigid and can be pushed in when you press your hand against it which is somewhat expected. The color is true to the pictures and all the zips work as expected. There are no separators in the bag itself which is good as you get more room to play with.
4
I love the Melbourne carry on. It is very expandable and holds more than it looks. Its light wieght  and a nice bright color that wont easily get confused with others at the airport. I used it for a 3 day travel and had lots of room for clothes for 3 days.
4
This is an excellent option given the $45 price point, if you don't mind CalTrans orange. The other colors are priced a bit higher but even so I am pleased with this bag. here are a few key points. Good 1. The plastic hardshell material is rigid enough to withstand being crammed into the overhead compartment. Given that it is a ziper closure, there is a bit of room for the bag to "squish" when compressed. As it compresses evenly given the rigidity of the hard shell I was not concerned about damaging the items in the bag. 2. I fly a lot of regional jets and this bag will fit perfectly into the overhead of the CRJ700. If you are on a CRJ700 don;t let them gate check you... it will fit. 3. It has nice touches that you would expect on higher end bags such as spring loaded handles and interior compartment separators. 4. It has an expansion fold that increases the volume of the bag if you are not planning on carrying it on. This was a nice feature that I did not see listed in the product description. The Bad 1. The pull handle is flimsy. It is loose and wobbly. I am concerned for its longevity. 2. The interior of the luggage had a very strong chemical odor when I first opened it. There is a "Prop 65" warning about chemicals that may case cancer etc... I am not surprised given this is an inexpensive made in China item. The odor dissipated after about 24 hours but if you are sensitive to these types of odors this bag is NOT for you. 3. The zipper seems sturdy, but on the second full zip/unzip I could see some of the teeth had crossed up. If I was more careful and I zipped slowly it seemed to work better. I will be more careful when I zip it in the future and I would not expect any problems. Overall I would buy this bag again. I expect this one to last years given my level of usage.
4
The luggage itself is light-weighted and looks nice, but the lock comes with it is poorly made. I set the lock using my own 3 digits and was not able to unlock it again no matter what...had to threw it away... wish I can get a second lock~
1
Clearly used, worn wheels, broken telescope handle, loose pieces clanking around inside.  I returned it promptly.  Not even worth the cheap price.  Returned it for a Kenneth Cole Reaction, definitely worth the extra $30.

We bought 2 of these for a 3 week trip through Europe. They made several airline flights, bus rides and train rides with us, and rolled down several old, uneven roads. We weren't rough on them--we were abusive! We packed and unpacked every couple of nights as we moved from hotel to hostel to monastery to hotel. We over-stuffed them and then sat on them to get the zippers closed. We used them as make-shift seats in crowded train stations. We crammed them into places they didn't fit. We lazily drug them behind us up and down stairs, allowing them to bang on each step on the way up and down. They are still alive and well. Pros: hard shell, inside zipper pouches and elastic bands to keep things organized, expandable in the middle for when you're flying back with too many souvenirs, smooth wheels, long handles, good quality external zippers, bright colors that stand out on the luggage belt. Held up under all our abuse, and the handles still slide in & out smoothly and the wheels still roll smoothly. Con: one of the inside zippers (that keeps one side separate) broke after being opened and closed about 50 or so times. The other zipper on the same track still works, but 4 inches or so remain open now. For the price, we are VERY pleased with our purchases. We packed duct tape just in case we needed to tape them together just to get home because we were worried the price would reflect the quality, but we were pleasantly surprised.
4
never had a carry on. its basically hard plastic, but it is functional and the price is low. I recouped 2/3 of the cost on a round trip flight where I would have paid $20 ea way for a bag. so it works for me.
4
It was a good size and it definitely turned heads...probably because I was a grown man rolling around a light blue suitcase!  It definitely is more roller friendly than the old, unpredictable two-wheelers.
4
Like the carry on size and the 4wheels for easy gliding. Meets my traveling needs. Like the construction of the luggage, The handle is a little wobbly when fully extended. It is still manageable.
5
Just purchased and recently used for trip. Excellent luggage provides a lot of space love the expansion and ease of use. Also most importantly it passes size guidelines for carry on.
1
Love the outside but the inside is pink... and we bought this for our son. It is being returned. We didn't read anywhere on the description that it was pink on the inside
5
such a nice little carry on for domestic and international travel. very light and holds a lot! also fits easily in the overhead bin on international flights.
5
I now use this suitcase every time I travel and it is very light and so far (5 trips) has traveled well. I have bought bigger ones too now for longer trips.
4
This was 0.5 inches larger than advertised and, thus, we were too concerned with it passing the carry-on requirements to use it for the major trip planned.
1
This thing smelled like gasoline when I got it and I couldn't get the smell out of my hands after touching it for several hours.  Returned it.
5
The perfect size and this color suits me as I have defective eyesight from a stroke, but the color makes it very easy for me to pick out.
4
Was able to pack more than I expected, how ever the inside strap broke on the first use :( However, it stood up well on my trip.
4
Awesome suitcase for traveling... fits everything I needed for a three day trip, its stylish and easy to spot on the conveyor belt.
5
For my and travel.
1
The carry on is light and seems like it can hold a lot. It also has several pockets/compartments so you can organize your clothes, shoes, etc. The reason I am giving this product one star is because of the horrible chemical smell from the plastic. I saw in the description of the product about the California proposition 65 warning but I did not think the smell was going to be so strong. I could smell the chemicals the moment I opened the box. I touched the product and I couldn't get the smell off my hands even after washing my hands four times with soap/hot water. The smell finally disappeared when I dunked my hands in a bowl of vinegar and lemon and then washed it off with hot water. I will be returning this product and investing a few more bucks into another carry on that does not have the California proposition 65 warning. The only reason I purchased this carry on in the first place was due to the price.
5
Bought this for a christmas gift, my son liked it, he will be going on a trip in about a week so the true test is yet to come
4
Very light weight. Not sure how long it will last. Very good for someone who has to put her luggage overhead by herself.
5
I purchased this for my mother as a christmas present. I was unable to find this quality of product for the price.
3
For the price it's ok, I've been taking 2 flights a week for the last 6 weeks and it's been working fine with minimal to no damage. Pros: Strong body, outer shell is strong and resistant, looks like it can take a beating and for me that's proven. Cons: 1- The handle: I did not buy the American Tourister option because I know their handle is flimsy, so I wanted to try another brand... it had the same problem. When pushing the handle suffers from significant torsion. 2- Wheels are equally flimsy, they've been holding up well but I feel one of them is going to break soon. If you are a casual, tourist traveler this might be good. If you're a business traveler who might all of a sudden fly a lot this might not be good, I'd buy one where I could replace the wheels.
5
Wonderful!  So light and is no worse for the wear of getting checked.  Extremely light and wheels spin nice.
3
shipped fast. very light weight. It made our  the trip to OH. Go and Back worked really well. Good purchase!
5
It's really durable and has been a great companion on my flights.  Holds a lot and saves me from check ins
3
I ordered 3 of these suitcases for my 3 boys for Christmas.  The blue and the orange both have a grey liner.  The red one has a pink and grey polka dot liner!  The son who received this was very disappointed (as was I).  No where does it indicate that the lining is pink.  We left on a trip the day after Christmas.  The other boys used their suitcases and they worked well.  Held up to being tossed around.  The wheels and expanding capabilities are a nice feature.  Wish I did not have to go through the hassle of returning this one.  We are choosing another color and I hope it comes with a gray liner! But I will not know until it arrives. Does not seem right.
4
Good carry-on for light to moderate travel. Have yet to see how the wheels hold up over time but overall a good carry-on. Since this is a carry-on you don't really have to worry about how it will hold up against baggage handlers. (As an aside - I have done some research and read that spinner type luggage doesn't normally get thrown around like regular baggage - simply because it can just be rolled easily but, I digress) The only thing I don't like is the extendable handle doesn't feel very sturdy. It's quite wobbly but seems to work OK for now. The interior is fine and has elastic straps on one side and a zipper partition on the other. Also includes a small zipper pouch. Should easily hold a few days worth of clothes.
5
love it! Got many compliments as I traveled. It's lightweight and can fit a lot of stuff in it.
1
When I received this bag, the color (champagne) was much more of a bright gold than the muted color I expected. Since it's a pain to return an item this large, I decided it wasn't a big deal and kept it. I noticed the handle extension seemed flimsy (as other reviews also mentioned) and I worried it might not last long. Well, unfortunately I was right. I'm a on week-long trip to multiple cities and the extension keeps getting stuck in the up position. This is really fun when boarding a plane and everyone is waiting behind me. I've had the suitcase for a little over a year but had a light travel year so I've probably only used it a dozen times. This suitcase is a waste of money.
5
Durable and very roomy.  The handle doesn't feel wobbly like on other luggage that I've owned.
2
The handle seems fairly cheap and got stuck for some time before it finally unjammed itself.
5
My wife and I both purchased this luggage for our many carry on travels.  I bought the black and returned it for the Mettalic as we observed the Mettalic had a bit different lining and a bit more room the way the exterior style was.  We have been very happy with this luggage, as fits well in carry on mode and can also expand a few inches if you are not carrying on a plane or even still works on certain airlines for carry on (Southwest for instance).  We have found it durable, very worth the price and would order again.  Highly recommend for a carryon if you are looking for a hard case. And the room is surprising for a piece of luggage with these dimensions.
5
Good bang for your buck.  High quality, durable and spinner wheels are very convenient.
4
I bought this before I made my first trip to Reno back in June. It wouldn't fit in the overhead compartment on the plane but that may because the planes Alaska Airlines uses to fly from Seattle to Reno are Twin Prop planes? But the Stewerdess on my flight was cool and gave me a green tag to put it on the baggage cart in Seattle and I was able to pick it up at the baggage cart in Reno. I went back to Reno for my GF's birthday in September and this time I was ready and grabbed a green tag as soon as I checked into my flight in Seattle. This is a really good suitcase and it suits me well
5
It is NOT expandable... but it is very roomy, love the divider inside, the toiletetry pouch was great. My husband and I both got the same luggage he got silver.. high quality, best part is the price, got it on sale for under 45$. Sturdy, well made, easy pull out handle. At first looked too large for carry on, many reviews said it is able to be carried on.. I measured it against my other old carry on, same size, just the top has a little bulge area, that made it look bigger..but perfect. Can't wait to use this going to Vegas in May, and many more trips this summer.
4
Size was great, rolls fairly easily (in line skates would be amazing) but the zippers felt cheap as well as the lining fabric. I also figured out I don't like not having outside pockets for items I may need access to quickly. I had to unzip the entire thing and flop it open in the airport - exposing the entire contents. However- the price is fair, it seems durable (I've only used it three times so far), it's lightweight and easy to use as a carry on. The wheels were a bit noisy and felt a little cheap. Perfect for my kids but didn't fit the bill for me.
4
This bag did not look sturdy at all and I knew it when I purchased it for a trip. I didn't want to worry about paying for baggage fees so I wanted something inexpensive. Well upon returning, I had apparently purchased too much body spray and had to check the luggage in. I was fearful but I checked it in anyway. Well, I must say I was quite impressed when the luggage showed up on the conveyor belt looking fully intact except for a couple of scratches. The wheels worked perfectly and even the handle was fine. So I was very happy with the purchase.
2
very shoddily made. the handle feels very loose when you jiggle it around.
1
I wanted to return this pretty pink hunk of junk but I didn't know how crummy it was until we used it. The handle is wobbly and won't stay up, the wheels work great when you go in a straight line but please don't turn or it'll tip over. I'm less annoyed about the waste of money that it was than I am about how much of a headache it was on our trip. I wanted my six year-old to be able to pull her own luggage and she wanted that too, but this thing was just too clumsy and hard to maneuver for her to do that.
4
Awesome traveling bag for the price.  The tall handle is a little wobbly, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  I took it as a carry-on for a 4 day trip.  I had plenty of room for all my stuff.  The wheels worked great - tuff to roll on all four on carpet - but just pull it like a regular bag on 2 wheels.  I only traveled on the smaller planes and I checked it at the gate each time.  I could not have fit it in the over-head bins on the smaller planes - not sure about the really big ones?
2
The wheels broke after few month of use and I did not travel a lot.
5
Great small suitcase for short trips.  Good quality. Wheels great
4
I've taken this bag on an air trip. It worked great - was able to fit several bulky winter outfits in it along with other stuff. Love the wheels, much less tiring to pull along than the old style wheeled bag. The color is great and easy to pick off the luggage carousel. So far, it seems quite sturdy. My only caveat is that the telescoping handle can be sticky but so far I've managed to get it to do what I need. All in all, a good purchase and I'm quite pleased with it.
3
It lasted 1 1/2 years before the handle broke; it is stuck in the upright position. It was good while it lasted and met American Airlines size requirements. It traveled with me on 3 trips and finally gave out on the steps of my return home. The outside shell was very durable and it was big enough for a week length stay (I am male so perhaps carry less items than some ladies might?) Since it is not very functional to me without it being able to roll it is being replaced.
5
Worked perfectly and allowed me to get onto even the smaller regional planes without checking my bag.  Many other carry ones on the smaller jets have to do the terminal check upon boarding the plane but this bag being so compact I am able to get around that.  The spinners work great and the carbon fiber look is much better then I thought. My only complaint is the plastic they wrap this with is a pain to get off around the handles and edges.
3
Pros: Light weight and seems durable. Size is perfect for a carry on. Inexpensive. I packed around 3 t-shirts, 2 shirts, 2 pair of jeans, 1 pair of shoes and it still had ample space for more. So, it's perfect for a weekend trip. Cons: The Bag is prone to scratches on the corners. I recently went on a trip and it got visible scratches quite easily. It smells like raw leather/shoe polish which is very pungent.
4
Great Value for Money. I have been using the bag for around 3 months now, mostly for domestic trips. It is spacious, the perfect size for a carry on and very and easy to maneuver and came at a great price. So far I am very happy with my purchase. The reason I gave it 4 starts was because it arrived with a broken zipper handle. I was able to fix it without too much trouble but I don't think that this bag is made of very durable material.
5
I have been so happy with this purchase. I have used it for 3 trips now and it fits a lot of clothes. It is also a good compact size for the over head bin. I like the way the wheels roll, I can roll upright or tilt it with no problems. When it first arrived it had a plastic odor but my clothes never smelled and I haven't noticed it since the first complaint from my husband (it was in his closet). I would buy this again for sure, great value!
5
I bought this because it was on sale and I was flying from Maine to California for a week. I needed something that was easy to maneuver, light, and I could carry on. This is perfect. When I got it my husband said it was ugly, I like the look. It is silver and a hard case. I was surprised at how much room there was when I opened it. It worked great for my trip and now my husband uses it every time he travels for work. Guess it's not too ugly?
5
Given the price, I thought this suitcase was going to be a cheap piece of junk that would survive maybe 3-5 trips. I'm currently in the midst of my 4th trip with the bag and I think it should have no problem soldiering on for at least a few more. I've packed the thing to well beyond its maximum capacity and the zippers and handles all stood up to the challenge. For the price, the bag looks great, functions well and exceeds my expectation.
4
Very Handy, stylish and lots of space. I just went on a trip and was carrying: 1) Iron, three hoodies, underwears(lol), a pair of shoe, a blanket, two pair to jeans, two pair of joggers and one pack of moisturizer, hair oil, comb, shaving kit, brush and paste. I did not need to expand the luggage and all fit eeeeeasyyyyyyy. I could have fit more stuff easily Easily fits in the shelves on board Uniter airline and US Airways
5
used it on multiple trips now. two trips to california and ohio with multiple stop overs. While the handle may feel a bit flimsy, it held up fine with no sign of breaking. It is great. There is a zipper to make the bag expand but I don't recommend stuffing it too much with that extra space if your riding on a smaller aircraft as it may not fit in the overhead when expanded. otherwise, perfect fit and the four free wheels are great.
5
I bought the turquoise 20" carry on and I LOVE it! I have been on several trips & it maneuvers extremely well. And it fits comfortably in the overhead bins. Even when I had to check it, it came through without a scratch! It had a strong plastic smell at first, but after I left it open for a few days, that went away. Gonna order the matching large size. And the floor really stands out. You can't go wrong for the price.
5
Nice suitcase that was plenty large enough for a week in europe. It feels a bit flimsy, but held up just fine being pulled along cobblestone streets. It does meet international and domestic overhead measurment criteria without a problem.  The zippers aren't a great design. I often tried using the wrong one to open up the bag, instead I opened the expansion zipper. Not a big deal. Overall I'm very happy with this suitcase.
4
I really like the outside of this luggage and the wheels; however, I was surprised when I opened it up and found the interior to be pink and white with pink polka-dots.
5
I took this on a recent three-day trip to Las Vegas and it worked great. Held my stuff in place nicely and managed to fit in all the clothes/shoes that an over packer needs for three days. Also, I was pleasantly surprised to open it and find a very pretty pink with white polka dot lining.
5
Solid little hard case carry on bag.  Expandable, nice rolling wheels.  Spinners are way more versatile than a 2 wheel design.
2
I was unhappy with the size.  The internal size was much smaller then other carry on luggage that I own.  The support bars are much thicker, which takes up a lot of room. The outside measurements are smaller then a child's luggage.
5
This is a real cool piece of luggage. It's very durable and it's not heavy (until l stuff all my things into it) and it will expand. It pulls very well on wheels. I only use it for 2 or 3 day trips. It travels well in my trunk. And it's a lovely pink color. It has a zipper cover for the stuff on one side and an elastic holder for stuff on the other side so the stuff you pack stays where you pack it. Highly recommended.
5
I travel a lot for various things, and this suitcase has gone between multiple states, on over 20 flights, through numerous security points. It has lasted through it all. I've also managed to pack for an entire week long trip, with multiple outfits/day, hair products, shoes, makeup, etc. with no problem. So spacious, sturdy, and easily maneuverable. Not to mention a great price for those of us on a tight budget!
1
I bought this as a gift for my mother.  She only used it a couple of times, and the handle broke.  (A piece of plastic that held the handle in place broke when she lifted it to put on the bed to unpack.)  There's a five year warranty, so the company will replace it; however, they are requiring her to send $40 for handling along with the receipt.)  I wish I'd spent a little extra for something of higher quality.
5
So far, so good. I have used this suitcase on only one trip (so far) as a carry on. I ordered it in the purple, which is a great color and one of the expandable models. It felt sturdy and rolled beautifully on all surfaces including the airport moving sidewalks. It was such a bargain that unless it breaks down in fewer than a half dozen trips I will consider it to be a great deal. Will update after more use.
1
Used it twice and one of the rear wheels is already broken.  Upon checking, I found out that the steel axle that went through the wheel was not properly inserted into a hole on the other side, causing the wheel to wear out unevenly and then break.  I cannot find the replacement part (A-08-???) so I am not able to use the luggage anymore.  $50 for using the luggage twice and that's much more expensive than renting one.
5
have used it a couple of times and I love it. It fits in the overhead storage bin on airplanes. I can pack enough clothes and shoes in it for 4 days or more. It rolls along behind me very well. I am a grandmother and it does not get too heavy for me to move by myself even when I have it packed ....it is made of very light but strong material. I would definitely recommend it .
3
We got our luggage today and we're so excited. I ordered the purple wave and I love it. My husband got the navy blue, it was beautiful, then we opened it up and on the expandable side it had a cover that looked like it was suppose to zip up. It had the track for the zipper but no way to zip it. My husband said he will keep it but I was not happy with the inside of his.
5
Love it! Great quality especially considering the price. Only has been checked once (I usually carry it on), but still looks and works like it's brand new. And hte pink polka dot lining is a nice touch. Love that the two halves are zipped separately from each other so I don't have to dig through my entire suitcase to find something, just the half it's packed in.
5
I bought this case due to great reviews and attestation to a great build quality. The reviews were spot on. I bought this to travel with me to the Dominican Republic. It held up magnificently and there are no issues nearly 2 years later. I also just recently used it to go to Disney World and it made that trip great. It shipped quickly and was in great shape.
4
I didn't heed the advice if fellow Amazon users. If you are reading this, know that the red version (at least) is lined on the inside with pink polka dots cheap fabric. That said, if nobody is going to see the inside of your suitcase, go ahead and buy this. It's a cheap, sturdy suitcase. Already survived 3 coast to coast trips with me.
1
This luggage looks nice but the quality is terrible. The handle was not working properly the second time when I used it. The material got scratched easily. Very disappointed!
5
Like it
5
This is a great piece of luggage
5
This holds a lot more than it looks. I travelled for a week, and I used this and a small back pack, and I was fine. I rarely even opened the zipper to expand it. And I never paid to check my bag. What's more is it's hard to lose with that color. Everyone else is trading black bags while they travel.
5
Excellent size and loved the color!
5
The item was exactly as described. Fast shipping, and we are very happy with the item. We used it on our first trip and it survived well.
5
Good piece of luggage. It's very sturdy and expandable, if that's an option you can use. This one should last a long time.
5
I love using this roll aboard!  Doesn't tip and really holds a lot.  I recommend it to all business travelers
5
Very nice. Can pack lot of things .....love it!! Light , durable, brought this during my recent tour. I will get the bigger version of this !!
5
I bought this piece of luggage as a gift my granddaughter as it is the perfect overnight or carry-on size.. She loves it.
5
This exceeded my expectations.  Fit an entire weeks worth of clothes and shoes comfortably and was still light and easy to maneuver.
3
It was a nice bag, but I had ordered for my teenage son. When we opened it, we discovered it has a pink lining. My son does not really want a pink bag.
2
Nice carry on, but the lining smells like petroleum!  Tried spraying with Febreze and left it outside overnight with no success.  Still had the odor weeks later.
5
I've had several carry on...from the really cheap ones to the expensive designer brand and this one is just right.
4
We purchased two of these after United Airlines sent email warnings that they would be strictly enforcing a maximum size of  9" x 14" x 22".  When they were delivered, I was concerned that the actual width was not 13" as listed but was closer to 15" when the side feet were included, but the cases were flexible enough that it looked like they could be squeezed down to 14" if necessary.  It turns out that United's bag sizer has some tolerance, so our cases easily passed without brushing the sides.  For cases this small, they have a decent capacity.  You open the case right down the middle, so you have equal-sized compartments in each side, plus it has zippered expandability if you are not worried about carry-on restrictions. Inside, the only pockets are in the fabric separating the two compartments, and I would have also liked something along the edges, but that was not a big deal.  The cases are very light and seem to be reasonably sturdy.  I expect them to hold up well for car travel and carry-on use -- not letting baggage handlers near them.  The spinner wheels are a nice convenience, although most cases have them these days.  Other reviewers have mentioned the warning that they contain a carcinogenic material.  We made the judgment call that the risk should be small, since: 1) The materials are non-porous;  2) The cases are lined; 3) We wrap many of our clothes when we pack; and 4) We use the cases to transport our things, not to store them.  We bought these in May, 2014, and will update the review if our experience changes.
5
Spinner takes too much room, so luggage case is smaller than other carry on.  Otherwise, great for the price.  Happy.
5
It holds much more than I thought. It is easy to pack. Very versatile. I easily had enough packed for five days!
5
It did well during our three week trip, getting on and off planes nine times.  It rolled easily and held all I needed for the trip.
5
This seems to be as good as Samsonite.  It has very good and strong retractable handle.  Lots of zippers and compartments inside.  I love it!

I bought two suitcases for my grandsons. The silver one was a nice color as was the red one, the problem was that the lining of the red suitcase was pink.  This did not go over well with a nine year old boy!  The bigger problem was that they smelled of chemicals and one of the cases had a sticker saying that the state of California was considering banning the cases due to chemical hazard. That was pretty daunting. The other case did not have this warning. I returned both cases for safety reasons
5
This luggage is attractive, durable, easy to use, and fits well on the airplanes. I would recommend again to anyone.
4
Well I love the outside , I picked red and the inside if pink with white dots not what I expected. Hahaha the handle is what has me worried very flimsy and I have not even used it yet.
4
Ordered this for my son who thought red suitcase would look cool!! Sadly the lining inside of the luggage was pink with white dots! I didn't think red color was just for girls!?
5
I planned a trip to NYC in January for March and I got all my affairs in order and the next thing I know the trip is next week and I realized I had no bag to carry my things in on the plane UH OH, since I didn't like the thought of my luggage filled with my electronics and delicates being away from my person I dipped into my travel expenses and got this little bugger. I love this bag! I made the right call. Pros: Fits i/t OHB like a glove Spacious Mini compartments for lotions, shampoos, or what have you. No worry about pesky spillage Cons: Arm felt almost too fragile and easily breakable
5
Great suitcase, perfect size and great price.  Only bad thing is the lock is not TSA approved but I have one that is so its not a deal breaker.
5
Good price for this quality! Really light luggage, perfect use for international flights and the possibility to increase the size of the luggage is very good.
5
Love! It's a great size for business travel.  The expandability is really handy. It has some built in organization which makes things easy to find and it's a beautiful sky blue turquoise so as to be easily identifiable in bag claim.
5
Solid, attractive, priced right, fits in the stowaway compartment above the plane seats.  Couldn't be happier unless they gave me one for free.
5
I like to pack light. I could either carry-on or check in this compact luggage.  It helped me organize :  If it is difficult to close... reduce the contents. Nice interior packing support, including a zipper pouch for a few items. Surprisingly, because this suitcase has a built-in expansion feature, I rarely found I had trouble zipping it, until packing the purchased items for the return trip. Easy to extend the  handle and roll smoothly.  This is my first choice in the future... unless I am going on a short hop and taking only a backpack.
5
I am very pleased with the size and effortless way I can move this around. Handles everywhere make it easy to lift as well. Plenty of room for short trips. And arrived in just a few days after ordering. Love my prime account!
5
I used this for a recent vacation. It was great as a carry on. It is lightweight and made it easy to use around the airport. :)
5
I bought this item for a trip to San Francisco as I did not want to wait around for any checked luggage after my flight. I am very happy with the four wheels, which made my life easier carting this bag around not only on the plane but also in the airport and the city streets in San Francisco.
3
First off, I was very pleased with the transaction. I bought two of these for my sons and both got here safely and on time. They both got to use them on our trip to Vegas. It's a great product over all. Both of them were able to fit up to a week's worth of items. The only issue is the fact that on one of them, the handle stopped locking while extended after just the first day.
5
The luggage exceeded my expectations! It fits me on all levels! I have been able to pack and store a lot more than I thought possible and even though it scratches easily, that is the least of my concerns. It's an excellent item!
5
Speedy delivery. Perfect for a young child or a teenager. Nice and big. Haven't traveled with it so cannot rate its performance. Have only tested it around the house and it seems durable and functional. Handle doesn't seem as durable but haven't had any negative experience with it. Wheels are perfect for traveling as it swivels in all directions. Nice vibrant blue. Sufficient storage inside. Came with a lock, which I didn't expect so that's a plus. My 16 1/2 yo LOVED it.
5
Bought one as a gift and one for me. I like to travel without checking a bag. It is hard sided and lightweight which is what I wanted. It is good quality. Wheels work nicely, no tipping when loaded. I had another type of hard sided luggage that would fall over when packed. Price was excellent and every bit as good as those that cost 2-4x more. Lining is not luxury material but works just fine. It had a new manufacturing of plastic type odor when first opened. I just left it open to air for a few days and it was gone. I just finished my first trip using it and I am pleased with it.
4
Very satisfied with my luggage. Lightweight and a great orange color. I cannot wait to start traveling more places with it.
4
Got this for my sister who just wanted a pink suitcase, it came fast and she was thrilled when she opened it, seems well built and durable, she has taken it on a few tribs and appears to be holding up well, great size, very roomy, holds alot of clothes. Would buy others when needing luggage, a great price too.
4
It is heavier than my last one, but that could be a positive if it lasts longer.  Only time will tell.
5
This is a great suitcase, it is very roomy and stylish. Fits perfectly in overhead bins. I recommend this suitcase!
4
seems like a very sturdy case but, the handle arms are very light and flimsy. like the spinner wheels. hope it stands up to the test of time.
4
Fits outer overhead bin, but not inner bins or under seat. Too tall with wheels to close bin door when stowed sideways.
5
This was the perfect size carry on bag.  Very sturdy and easy to move with 4 wheels.  The handle was a bit shaky when fully extended, but there was no difficulty with it.  We also bought one in black.
4
This bag looks great, holds a lot, fits the carry-on size dimensions and is affordable. The wheels make it very easy to move. Would have given five stars except there was a warning on the tag that said some material in this bag contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer. We used it anyway and just made sure we kept it aired out and washed hands after use (?!!!). So I guess you should use it at your own risk.
3
This case has only been used once, dragged around 2 airports, and the flimsiness of the handle had me envious of fellow travelers who'd spent more for a more sturdy case.  After pushing it on all 4 wheels for a while my arm hurt due to the amount of play between the case and the handle.  Also, I had to keep it outside for 2 days after it arrived due to heavy off-gassing;  I had set a blouse on top of it during my pre-trip packing and it smelled like diesel fuel when i picked it up the next morning.  Nonetheless, you can cram a lot of stuff in it, it has dividers and a strap inside, and looks decent.
5
Wonderful piece of luggage as a carry on.  With U.S. airlines insulting customers and destroying their reputations worldwide, i.e. cutting service, heinous delays, rude staff, and unconscionable prices to check bags, this lightweight, well designed piece is a well come travel companion.
2
The suitcase is exactly what I wanted: hard case, four casters and carry-on size. The color was good too. The suitcase however had a strong petroleum odor; so strong that it was unusable. I left it sitting on the porch for two weeks to air out, but the smell is still overwhelming. Not sure what happened. I'm currently exchanging, will update review if it goes well.
4
I really like this case, and the reason I got orange was to be able to easily distinguish it from the sea of black luggage surrounding it. I have found that I could have gone smaller for a few reasons: 1. For 2-3 day trips, I actually have excess room inside leaving things to move or shift inside the case. This includes an extra pair of shoes, night bag, clothes, etc. A 15-18" case might better use available space. 2. I often gate check this which is fine, b/c trying to hoist it into the overhead is clumsy and it takes up a lot of room. If someone else already has a bag there, forget it. On bigger aircraft it is less of a problem, but you should gate check it on puddle jumpers. Otherwise, I really enjoy the ability to wheel it in front of me as a spinner or behind me as a standard wheeled piece. Very roomy, stylish and functional. The price is right too, making it a great value. Be warned however, this is lightweight stuff and is not designed to have gorillas jumping on it like Samsonite. This is designed for short weekend type trips, not extended overseas, round-the-world kind of travel.
4
For the price this suitcase has a good quality outside and an ok handle. The arms connected are a little wobbly when rolling the suitcase but overall happy with the size! Great for taking on a plane. It fit easily in all the compartments so far.
5
Had no problem with this piece falling when rolling like pieces in the past, and fits perfectly under the seat in front of you. Great when a hard case is needed.
4
Just wish I would have realized that it was pink & white on the inside before I bought it for my son!
5
But I wished the lining inside would be unisex color/design instead of pink polka dots. Overall a good buy and quality item.
5
I traveled all of the mid-west with this case.  It is holding well, nothing broke yet (knock on wood).  Fits in overhead on most planes.  Where it doesn't, the crew offers a free check-in, which i usually accept.  It survived about 5-6 check-ins, no damage. Handles are on both a top and a side, which is convenient for loading into the overhead.  This case is a great value in my opinion.
5
I received my luggage order approx a week later. I was more than delighted with it. The pictures on line did not do it justice. I am extremely delighted with my purchase!
4
I am very happy with this luggage. It's very light weight and easy to handle.The lining fabric is very pretty. If the  handle hight could be changed in not only two but three or four ways, I would give this 5 stars.
4
Works great. I travel a lot for work and it has held up as a carry on for numerous trips. I only wish it had more pockets inside for storage. It also tends to roll away from you on some surfaces if you aren't paying attention
4
I like the construction and the material is very sturdy. However, I think the handle could have been improved, it is shaky (especially if you carry something heavy). The wheels are not the best quality either, but for the price it is still a good offer!
5
ordered two of these for my fianc? and I for our trips together.  we absolutely love these!  and for the price, couldn't go wrong.
2
I like the material but the acessories are not so good. The foot part broke in the first trip. I reccomend just for use inside cabin.
3
I bought this for my son, needless to say it is going back.  Awesome little suitcase, just not masculine enough for a teenage boy!
5
I compared a lot of hard cover luggage and decided to take a leap and purchase this one.  I was able to load a ton of clothes in here and they came out great - wrinkles were non existent!  I ended up checking the back at the gate, as the flight was full.  It came through the baggage return just fine. The only thing I would note is the handle is just a little flimsy, but honestly wouldn't worry about it at all!
4
LOVE this...super light, easy for my 7 year olds to pack, carry, wheel around and manage. PLENTY of room, rugged, love the way it looks (we have 3)...only complaint is that the handle feels loose and kind of cheap. Not that it has failed yet...just feels like it.
5
We've had this for a couple of months, the wheels are nice and the suitcase roles very easily.  The color is very pink, just like the picture.
3
Handle is wobbly , wheel doesn't really roll side ways.capacity is good, divider zipper is  convenient. I was a little disappointed that it doesn't roll side ways.
5
Wonderful for carryon. Used it on a recent business trip. I was able to pack for 5 days with room to spare. Suitcase very light so easy to lift into overhead compartment and in and out of my car. The color is also very pretty and fun!
4
I bought it for light traveling. It has several compartments, and it's easy to handle. It does it's job and looks clean.
5
This is a great little suitcase.  I was looking for a spinner bag to use with my pieces of Vera Bradley-Very Berry Paisley luggage.  This matches great and is exactly what I was looking for. The inside is nicely finished.  One side is zippered storage and the other has a long zippered pocket and an elastic "X" strap to hold items in place. The suitcase handle extends to a good length. (It did seem a little shaky but performance was not effected.)  I was able to  move it with ease.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5
I liked this piece of luggage. It's not a hard shell, so you probably don't want to check the bag too often. But, it's intended as a carry-on, so I suggest using it that way. The handle is sort of flimsy, and that's my only complaint. Held up on an around-the-world trip!
1
it has a chemical smell that will not go away
5
I love, love, love the Rockland Melbourne 20"!  It's the perfect carry-on size, easily stores in the overhead compartment, and it was very easy to wheel around busy airport traffic during the past Christmas season.  I packed for 5 days and it easily accommodated my clothes, hairdryer, and shoes, etc.  Thank you Rockland.  Great luggage.
1
I loved the price and it worked well for the first couple of trips.  Then the stitching came undone from the zipper, even though I had not over-packed, so that now even when zipped there is a gaping hole.  Trying to find out if there is a warranty, but unfortunately threw the tags away. :(. I guess you get what you pay for.
5
This compact piece of luggage is definitely useful for weekend trips. It is very easy to maneuver. The wheels don't stick when going from floor to carpet. The spinner wheels make it esy to push or be pulled. The space inside is roomy , and it has 3 pockets for toiletries. Great price, and as usualndelivery was on time.
5
Perfect for quick trips. Don't have to fear losing your checked luggage. Just take this on the plane and you don't have to worry. Hold a lot more stuff than I thought it would. Did have a plastic/foam smell when it arrives but I just febrezed the Heck out of it and also some perfume I wrest and then it was perfect.
2
I like this because it is very light, but I feel like the wheels will go bad quickly. All wheels are still functioning, but one wheel started making rattling noise after first trip. Another wheel with same noise after second trip. Third trip and another wheel. I hope the wheels are replaceable later.
1
The wheels on this piece of luggage don't roll.  The luggage is useless for its intended purpose.  It has no business being sold.  I have no qualms with the provider of this item.  They have been very responsive, but the product is a disaster.  My recommendation is to buy ABS luggage from a different manufacturer.
3
I bought this product because of its low cost, but you get what you pay for. It still works three months later (I travel twice weekly for work), but the side protectors have fallen off the the screw stick out and poke me when I grab my bag. I would have gotten something different if I could do it again.
5
It survived my return trip Toronto to San Francisco. Some white gluey stuff is coming off at the bottom, but it was dead cheap so I can't complain that it isn't 100%, and this doesn't seem to have any structural impact... yet. It looks pretty tidy - got some compliments for the "cute" suitcase.
5
Very nice. Work great.. holds alot too.
4
Light weight and good looking.  Much easier to handle than several other smaller items.  I found when it was "packed" that the wheels didn't track straight.  It was also hard to lift over my head to put into overhead compartment.  Looks like it might end up being checked luggage after all.
5
I bought this when I needed something sturdy to protect some interview materials.  The case protected my fragile goods very well and has shown lot of durability on three round trip flights.  It's a great piece if luggage for the price... And the pink matches my accessories rather well
1
This luggage is good looking but the toxic odor forced us to put it out on the deck until we were able to box it up and send it back. Meets all the specs and looks good but I won't use a product like that. It says on the tag that California won't sell it because it is carcinogenic!
3
The case is pretty decent, one trip and it has dent marks from the plastic sides. I'm not sure how long it will last. It looks sharp. the tall handle isn't very sturdy, the large suitcase from Wal-Mart I bought held up better, and it went below the plane. You get what you pay for.
5
I traveled with this bag internationally recently.  Although I didn't want to take too much in it for weight and ease of carrying myself, it packed easily and comfortably.  Getting on and off trains with it was made easier by its light weight, even for my advanced age!  Thank you!
3
Really like this piece, it's light weight And can pack a lot of stuff. Problem is one of the wheels locked and eventually melted on a trip where we had a lot of walking to do so I ended up having to carry it everywhere I went. If it wasn't for the wheel failure, it'd get 5 stars.
5
Great luggage, especially for price. Lightweight, roomy, well designed inside. Wheels around smoothly. Easy to grab and stow above or in trunk. Only flaw is the handle release stops are a little tricky, making it hard to get the handle to the right height and keeping it there.
5
Nice little carry-on for my kid.  Design wise, it's pretty simple.  The rollers are good and handle adjusts for both kids and adults.  Inside, it's basically just a couple big compartments.  But, one side does have a zippered lining for either shoe or dirty laundry storage.
4
So far so good - sturdy, rolls well, lighter than some carryons, easy to spot from color. It is quite smelly when first opened, highly recommend airing it in the garage or outside to off gas. No issues with odors after airing it out. Will update as I get more use.
1
This is made from materials known to the State of California to cause cancer. That was not what Inexpected to see on the suitcase once it arrived. If you are okay with that statement it seems like an okay suitcase for the price, but if not, but something else.
3
Its ok. Not a fan of the interior but that isnt so important. Very light Indeed. Feels a bit cheap, especially the handle, like it will break soon but time will tell. A part at the botom was breaking when I got it. I guess i will use some glue on it.
4
This suitcase is a little larger than I expected, and I like the bright color.  It appears very sturdy.  I have not yet taken it on a trip, but it seems that it will hold all I need for a short trip comfortably and stand up well to airport handlers.
2
Right now I'm giving this product 2 stars, as although it LOOKS great, the zipper broke  after the 2nd use, having owned it for less than 6 months.  If the warranty that this product came with holds up, I will re-review at that time with more stars.
4
for the price, this is a great carry on. I have only traveled with it twice but its pretty sturdy. the only flimsy part is the handle which seems a little weak when you try and push the wheels in different directions. Other than that, its a good product.
1
Used it on 4 flights as a carry on only without the slightest abuse.  On the 4th time I reached up to grab the handle to pull it down from the overhead and the metal parts attaching the handle to the case literally crumbled in my hand.
5
Got three of these for our "Go Bags". Color coded we know how's is who's - even got one for the pets. Very light so does not add much to overall weight. Small enough to store in a closet. Easy to take and load into car.
4
Love the color!  I was nervous the silver would be too shiny.  It's a matte finish and the luggage is very light.  I love the four wheels. I do think the handle isn't really that sturdy but for the size it should be fine.
5
This is awesome. Perfect for a couple day trip. I packed 4 days of clothes makeup and shoes in this and had no trouble closing the lid. The cover is not rock hard but it does provide some protection from travel damage.
4
It is my second time purchasing this bag for my teenage boys. Its carry-on size and ruggedness worked very well during many travels. The price is reasonable and the blue color is great. It stands out at baggage claim.
5
This suitcase was perfect for my recent trip.  It met the carry-on requirements, was very sturdy and held up very well.  The swivel wheels made it so easy to maneuver through the airport.  I highly recommend it.
5
Great product for the price! I'm always an over-packer and easily run out of room in carry-ons, but this luggage has a TON of room and is designed extremely well. Definitely one of the best purchases I've made.
5
Love the look and the fact that it is so light weight.  Will be great as a carry on for the plane for our shorter trips.  No more luggage fees for me :-)  So excited to use it for our first trip to Las Vegas.
5
I am very pleased with the carry on. I had to pack one weeks worth of stuff for a road trip and then fly back and this carryon was very handy. Also just fit in the overhead when fully expanded. All is good.
5
Sturdy, moves easily and is light.  Fits easily in overhead bins on planes. Although it is small, I can fit a week's worth of travel clothes in the case including one pair of sneakers.  Highly recommend.
1
I bought this carry on to travel. i travel quite often and this suitcase looks amazing, however after just two trips the inside began to tear and the handle began to break. immediately i returned it.
5
Purchased the metallic of this for my husband and he loves it. Although the interior has white circles design, he doesn't seem to mind. It rolls very easily and has plenty of room for its size.
5
Will be a gift, but by examination, for the price:  it is very well structured, color will be loved by recipient, and wheels appear to function well for this price.  I am pleased with purchase.
5
This almost matches our set from this company of a year ago. We like the look as it is classy and easy to find on the carousel. Multiple trips and no damage from the airline handling.
5
This is my go to suitcase now. I've brought this to me to China on a study abroad and it worked great. I was able to fit much clothes in here. A great blue color and very light weight.
5
works great sturdy. but i didn't like the color i got.bright orange. next time i know i should go to department stores to check out the colors before ordering online.
5
Wow! I have never known what a well-made suitcase was before buying a rock land. There are so many neat inside features. I would definitely recommend this product.
4
Good for the money and having used it a few times I have no complaints. It comes with a protective plastic film that's a real pain to remove but no other issues.
5
Purchased this luggage for my 16 year old son. He used it all summer for weekend traveling. Lightweight and compact and has plenty of storage space. He loves it.
5
Really nice luggage!
5
Amazing I love it, got it for a big trip and it worked perfectly! Wheels are greats for all ground, no problems! I will keep this brand in mind for next buy.
5
I love the color. The zippers are strong and easy to operate. Size is perfect and the extension give much more room when open. I can't wait to use it.
3
It's a decent suitcase. The handle is by no means stable, however, and the suitcase is prone to turn slightly if you use all of the spinners at once.
5
The luggage is amaaaazing. Very light weight and I like the mat finish of the bronze color. I bought it for my mother, and she loves it very much.
5
Great luggage.  They made it to Hawaii and back and look like new.  They fit under the seats or in the upperluggage compartments of the airlines.
5
Mine is the metallic one, and it DOES expand. It's exactly what I need for my week long trip to Hong Kong. Plenty of space, and super light.
5
Best piece of luggage I have ever owned.  It holds enough for at least 7 days of clothing and articles.  It rolls well, and is light weight.
4
Great price; spacious, rolls well. Only minus is weight: I'd prefer that it be lighter. One road tested it and will flight test it tomorrow
5
5 Star because its a nice piece of luggage, built tough, wheels are nice feature because they rotate 360 degrees, no need to tilt to roll.
1
Not even worth a quarter of the price,,,,After using it on one trip domestically,, it just fell apart. The telescopic handle wouldn't collapse.... It just got stuck on it extended position.. The Worst thing is that i didnt checked it in,, I used it as a carry-on...so it wasn't missed treated by the baggage handler...Garbage...
4
I have used this luggage on 4 flights & 1 road trip. So far I am very impressed. I like the ability to have 2 separate compartments.
1
Liked the design but on first use both handles broke off. What a piece of crap. Do not buy!
4
Great size, rolls really well. My daughter also has one and she is very tough on luggage and the suitcase has held up wonderfully.
5
Very nice piece of luggage. I bought for my 5 year old son, for an upcoming vacation. It rolled well and inside is very nice.
5
Gift for my father.  He hasn't travelled since I gave it to him Xmas morning but he said it was just what he was looking for
3
Perfect size, but the pull up handle seems a little flimsy.  It hasn't broken, but it makes me nervous every time I use it.
2
The construction of the handle is seriously flawed and has now collapsed completely.  All in all, yhr quality is inferior.
5
Ordered for my 8 year old son so wasn't expecting much. Very impressive at this price level. Would order again for myself.
5
This is the best piece of luggage I've ever bought. Price was on point. Gotten many compliments on it. Fits as a carry-on.
5
This was a gift and my sister loved it. The size is perfect, however she hasn't been able to use it so time will tell
5
Better than I expected it to be. Now I want one! Easy, light, roomy. This is a perfect carry on for adult and child!
1
The handle broke BEFORE I ever used it. Had to lug it around anyway, wouldn't buy a Rockland piece of luggage again
4
Size was perfect. Rolling with 4 casters, wonderful. Was amazed at how much I could pack into this size of luggage.
4
Good suitcase for the price. I wonder how it will hold up as checked baggage.  I have only used it as a carry on.
5
Great for domestic travel. Enough space for a week's clothes and stuff. Light-weighted, slightly loose handle.
5
Easy to roll, fits nicely in the over head compartment and really like that it has the expand option..Love it!
4
Love this bag. Small and compact and fits will on all planes. Only wish there was one outside compartment.
5
FDA size approved for carry on. Hard sided, 4 swiviel wheels, compartments and zipper pouch, GREAT luggage
1
Horrible material, paper thin and cheap. Damage (caved in) during shipment.  Return for money back.
5
I bought this for my work kit. ( on location hair & makeup) it's the perfect size and lightweight.
4
Well constructed Easy to use More room than meets the eye Great deal!!!!!!!!!
5
Really loved this suitcase. Just the right size. Fits a lot. Very light and easy to manage.
5
great quality for the price. make sure to check the prices for each color as it may vary.
5
Compact & light. Spins on a dime! Hopefully it will meet airline reg's for overhead bin.
5
Very nice luggage. Perfect size and color, for a very reasonable price. Quick shipping!
5
Was perfect, right size for airline & fit all my stuff in it, tough too, but pretty!
5
Wife loves this carry on, much more roomy than it looks. Style and color are great.
3
I was very excited about this purchase, but found that the handle is rather loose.
5
I liked it, good quality, good seller service, fast delivery. I am very satisfied.
5
light weight, and holds a bit. i think i would not want to check it  many times.
1
The quality weren't good. The handle broke on my 1st experience. Not recommended
4
This product was really good to use and  it had more room to store my stuff in .
4
Fits a good amount of clothing and it's nice looking. Easy to store as carry on
1
Unhappy with purchase.  Zippers won't line up properly to allow placing lock
5
very nice luggage bag, a little smaller than i thought but still works great
5
My granddaughter loved this pink suitcase. Put some frozen stickers on it.
4
Sturdy. Compact. Can fit four days travel clothing in this small roll-on.
5
Perfect carry-on size so I don't have to pay crazy checked baggage fees.
4
Look like they will do the job. Will update after using them for travel.
5
Beautiful color. A subtle plum. Well-made yet lightweight.Heluva deal.
5
Love it everything fits nice and comfortable good for a one week trip
5
I have only used this a couple times but this little suitcase is perfect for weekend trips or smaller business trips. The wheels work great, it's lightweight, easy to maneuver and easy to identify, if you choose to check it (which I do with almost all my luggage). In addition, it seems pretty scratch resistant and pretty good quality!
5
Perfect travel and carry on size! Very sturdy and well made suitcase. The hardshell gives you that extra peace of mind. Must have for frequent fliers!
5
Well pleased with this carry on suitcase.  The color is beautiful and it seems to be well made.  The price was good to at $60 compared to $100 or more elsewhere.
5
It is perfect carry on and overnight bag. It holds a lot,  is easy to handle and stylish as well.

I bought this for my 12 year old son who loves red but was surprised to see the "girly" lining.  I looked again and no where in the description does it mention the color/pattern of the lining.  This is an important detail - please include in your description!  Otherwise  the material seems pretty durable and the size is just right for a carry-on.  I'm returning it as long as it is not too expensive since the box it came in was huge.

I bought this suitcase in red my 8 year son whose favorite color is red. Nowhere on the description does it say that the inside would be pink with white polka dots. We will be returning this item.

Quality appears excellent. Have not used it yet.  Time will tell.  I may add to the review after some good use.

The lining was pink, didn't go over well with my teenage son.

Good bag but zipper pull broke off and the handle is loose.

1. The bag is really small. It is much smaller than a regular carry-on and smaller than most 20" carry-ons. The inside of the bag can hardly hold enough clothes for a 3-day trip. 2. The inside of the bag is PINK (for the red exterior bag). I would have no problems with the above two if this was clearly labeled in the product description. But it was not.
5
Great quality I've had it for three flights and I love it
4
Could use some outside pockets.  Otherwise looks great
5
Very Spacious and easy to handle with the four wheel.

it is small,suitable for short trip ,less than 5 days
4
Great for the money but the handle is finicky/loose.

I'm irritated that I ordered this piece, and nowhere does it say that the inside of the red luggage was pink with polka dots. Not opposed to a fun pattern on the inside, but my son won't go for it. Back to amazon and stressing about finding another one--a nice neutral one--for Xmas.

Probably a great little carry on except they put the zippers in backwards. I might understand if it was $20, but not for $55. No thanks. I returned the item.

Just received this in the mail to give to my boy for his 10 year birthday. We opened it up and the inside of the luggage is all pink. I could not find where this was described anywhere in the specifications. The outside is red, but the whole inside liner is pink - doesnt go well with the expectation of my boy...otherwise appears to be a great option.
3
i don't think this is a well made product based on its price, and the color pink is just too bright. but overall i think it's fine

Two pieces of luggage were purchased for a long vacation in February, but both my husband's and my carry on was faulty and not easy to pull due to the inferior constructed pull out handle.  They looked so good, but could not hold up in the airport the first day out.
4
i like it. but it smells a little bit ...... and the quality is good enough to handle my bunch of clothes!!!!!!
3
This is a cheap suitcase.  Expect marginal quality.  I used this suitcase for a quick three day business trip.  After that trip, I could tell that this suitcase will not last long.  Granted for the price you pay it's an okay value.  It wouldn't surprise me if I can get a couple of years out of this bag. The wheels and handle seem like they will go first.  They are really bad quality.  The other parts seem like they might last for quite awhile.  This thing could last for a very long time if you don't mind having a bag you need to carry around.

I purchased this one as a carry on and "Delsey Luggage Helium Shadow Lightweight 4 Wheel Spinner, Platinum, 29 Inch" as a check in bag. Since its a carry on it doesn't take as much beating but yet after 3 trips Delsey holds up much better, the wheels on this one are poorly designed and don't roll very smooth and don't switch directions well. It looks much cheaper as well, but if not for bad wheel design I could've probably used it for much longer...

The size was perfect and also the color, enough space, and perfect for hand package, my girlfriend loved it! i really recommend it and the shipping was excellent, great conditions and quickly

Seems like a good deal for the money. Time will tell as this is a gift for a family member.

Ordered my grandson the red Rockland carry on because his brother has an orange one and they love it. I have never been so shocked to open the luggage to find the interior to be not only pink, but PINK POLKA DOTS!!!!! Unless you want this for a female, you will not want to buy this piece of luggage. I feel this should be plainly stated in the description. I paid an extra $12 to have it shipped sooner, I am concerned at getting my full purchase price back as well!!
1
Nice enough for the price but it has a label on it that clearly states it 'contains chemicals that are known to cause cancer and damage to your reproductive system'. Amazon sent me a return slip and promised to look into the matter. Scary stuff!!! :(

I am sincerely disappointed, in my first use while going in a long holiday the zipper opened on the side exposing part of my stuff to dust. I wouldn't buy Rockland again ever.

Great suitcase but I purchased this for my grandson in red and the inside is pink with white polka dots.  Odd combination.

We bought this for our son for Christmas. It's a nice suitcase but when we opened it, to our surprise, the lining is PINK POLKA DOTS!! We looked all over the internet and could not find one single picture of the inside of the red suitcase. Lame. We had to return it or he'd get made fun of on every trip he ever takes.
5
Looks absolutely great and came shipped in perfect condition. Used for first flight over the weekend as my carry on and performed as expected. Nothing broke, it was quite durable since my cab driver dropped it onto the ground hard and nothing happened, and held more than enough for a long weekend away. I would definitely recommend!

Cheap cheap cheap.

great luggage

Upon opening the box, a terrible toxic chemical smell came flying out of the box. It was strong and overwhelming. Although I did not remove the luggage from the box, I liked the color of the luggage. I just could not stand the toxic smell for more than a minute or two - so I immediately re-taped the box up and threw it out in the garage. I ended up ordering "Olympia Luggage Luxe 21" Expandable Carry-On Upright Bag" - see my review on it. Well worth the extra $ and zero chemical odors!

Not satisfied The luggage was already damage and it was to late for me to send back. No I will not

very high sell not big to match the scrod not very tide the not very power not bad color good

I ordered the red one for my nephew for his birthday. It didn't state this anywhere in the product description, but the inside fabric is pink with white polka dots. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have ordered it. Also, I was guaranteed 2 day delivery. It arrived 2 days after the expected delivery date.

GREAT LUGGAGE if you like PINK. Not sure why they dont list the interior color on the product description. This was purchased for my son...but he wont be carrying red luggage with pink polka dots inside.

Perfect

After receiving this which I purchased it for my 9 year old granddaughter....I was looking at the tag attached to the luggage while packing for a vacation...it had a cancer warner about the product.  I had already thrown all packing away as we were going to travel.  I was afraid to have this little girl use it.  I am not sure what to do or how I really need to worry about this.  She was extremely upset and I had a difficult time explaining this to her.  I think the company should disclose things like that prior to the purchase and why would they sell something that has a risk?
1
Nice luggage but pink inside - returned it for the purple one!  The description should have said that!  I am waiting for the replacement!
3
Luggage was just as described, but after it arrived, I decided that I didn't want a hard-sidded travel bag. Amazon was great about letting me return it and promptly gave me a refund. I ended up purchasing this: High Sierra A.T. GO 22" Carry-On Drop-Bottom Expandable Duffel with backpack. Although it cost twice as much, it will work out much better for my purposes.
